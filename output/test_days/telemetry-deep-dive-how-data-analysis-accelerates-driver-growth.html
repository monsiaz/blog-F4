    <h1>Telemetry deep-dive: how data analysis accelerates driver growth</h1>

Motorsport has evolved far beyond the days of mechanical intuition and seat-of-the-pants driving. In modern Formula 4 (F4), teams like AS Motorsport leverage sophisticated data acquisition systems, advanced telemetry, and detailed performance analysis to shave tenths (or sometimes even thousandths) of a second off each lap. While adrenaline, determination, and raw driving talent remain essential ingredients for success, the science of data-driven improvements cannot be understated. Especially for young drivers still refining their craft, telemetry is the ultimate feedback tool—showing precisely where time can be gained, how to safely push the car to its limits, and which adjustments yield tangible on-track benefits.

Below, we will explore how AS Motorsport taps into telemetry to develop promising talents like Andrea Dupe, Mathilda Paatz, and Sebastian Bach. You will discover the key data that cements driver growth, see how the team integrates telemetry across daily operations, and learn how these practices have shaped AS Motorsport from its rally roots to its current role as a major contender in F4 championships across Europe. This deep dive will illustrate the synergy between technology and training, culminating in faster lap times, smarter racecraft, and a more competitive environment for everyone involved.

<h2>Understanding the essence of telemetry</h2>

Telemetry, in its simplest form, is the electronic transmission of data from a race car to engineers in real time, or the collection and analysis of that data after on-track sessions. In the discipline of F4, telemetry breaks down a driver’s performance into quantifiable metrics. Steering inputs, throttle application, braking points, gear shifts, suspension travel, tire temperatures, and more are captured through an array of sensors. These devices constantly measure a car’s every movement and feed information into a data-logging system.

While F4 cars do not always have the same number of sensors or the purely digital dashboards that exist in higher formulas, the fundamentals of data analysis remain. For AS Motorsport, the shift from purely mechanical feedback to advanced telemetry has been a game-changer, giving the team and its drivers the quantitative basis to make rapid, targeted improvements.

In earlier times, motorsport teams relied heavily on driver feedback—sometimes contradictory, often influenced by adrenaline, and always subjective. Today, telemetry brings clarity. It tells engineers exactly how the car behaves at each corner by measuring:

• Speed traces through braking zones and apexes.  
• Throttle application across corner exits and long straights.  
• G-forces indicating lateral loads and traction limits.  
• Brake pressure, expressed in pressure curves that illuminate whether the driver is trailing or slamming the brakes.

Couple that with on-board footage, and you have one of the most powerful tools in driver coaching: the ability to correlate the driver’s on-track input with real, indisputable numbers.

<h3>From rally to formula cars: a data-driven journey</h3>

AS Motorsport’s history dates back to the rally stages of Slovenia, Croatia, and Italy, where grit and creativity often overpowered the technology used. Achieving success required skillful mechanics, careful reconnaissance, and bold commitment from drivers. Over the years, as the team shifted from rally to Formula Renault 2.0, then progressed into F4, it embraced the necessity of improved telemetry. Early rally campaigns often hinged on localized knowledge and mechanical know-how, but with the introduction of formula cars, data became indispensable.

Today, AS Motorsport competes in multiple prominent F4 championships: F4 Italian, Euro 4, and F4 CEZ, as well as the Formula Winter Series for off-season training. The leap from rally to circuit racing prompted massive changes in the team’s approach. Instead of dealing primarily with pacenotes and stage intervals, AS Motorsport’s engineers now concentrate on corner splits, apex speeds, and gearshift patterns. This reliance on telemetry provides not only data for performance optimization but also a systematic method for shaping young drivers. From analyzing how deeply a driver brakes into Misano’s sweeping corners to studying throttle modulation in the altitude changes of Motorland Aragon, data insights drive improvements like never before.

<h3>Core advantages: from novice to near-expert</h3>

In environments like the F4 Central European Zone (CEZ) or the prestigious F4 Italian Championship, the margins for error are razor-thin. Teens fresh out of karting are competing side by side with second-year drivers hoping to catch the eye of higher-level teams. Telemetry flattens the learning curve, ensuring rookies can train methodically and shorten the typical adaptation timeline.  

1. Objective feedback: Drivers often exclaim, “I braked as late as possible,” but numbers never lie. Telemetry reveals if the brakes were applied a meter later or earlier than the most efficient reference.  
2. Consistency tracking: A driver’s lap times may be quick, but if they can’t replicate them consistently, race results suffer. By examining speed traces and braking patterns, coaches ensure habits are ingrained instead of random.  
3. Instant debrief: The same afternoon a practice session finishes, data is stacked on top of reference laps from previous days. Drivers can see exactly where they have improved—or regressed—and refine their approach in real time.  

For AS Motorsport’s official driver trio—Andrea Dupe, Mathilda Paatz, and Sebastian Bach—this emphasis on telemetry ensures every on-track action is deliberate. They match data from their test sessions at Cremona or Vallelunga with benchmarks established by more seasoned drivers, giving them a precise performance gap to close. Through repeated cycles of driving, data analysis, and adjustments, their race craft evolves with each outing.

<h2>Key data points that fuel driver growth</h2>

High-level telemetry systems can measure an incredible variety of parameters, but focusing on the fundamentals yields the best returns, especially in F4 where budgets and time on track may be more limited than in higher categories. Here are several critical types of data that expedite a driver’s development:

1. Speed trace  
   The speed trace is a cornerstone of car-and-driver analysis. It indicates velocity at each millisecond around the circuit. By overlaying the traces of a rookie driver and a reference lap from an experienced driver, differences in minimum corner speeds and braking points become strikingly clear. The more advanced driver might carry 10 km/h more into a specific corner while still maintaining a tight line. This encourages the rookie to gradually push beyond their comfort zone.

2. Throttle application  
   The best drivers in F4 master the art of seamless throttle transitions, balancing the car’s grip levels while accelerating out of corners. A telemetry readout shows precisely how quickly or gently a driver applies the throttle after apex. Aggressive application can cause wheelspin and compromise exit speeds, whereas too cautious an approach leaves valuable tenths on the table. Through data, the driver can see how fine throttle control improves corner exits.  

3. Brake pressure and brake release  
   In junior formulas like F4, smooth and precise braking makes a huge difference in lap times. Telemetry logs the foot pressure on the brake pedal and how it’s released leading up to the apex. Often, experts “trail brake” into corners, gradually releasing pedal pressure to balance the car. A novice might snap off the brakes too suddenly, causing weight transfer issues. Detailed brake pressure curves point out these suboptimal habits quickly.

4. Steering angle and steering rate  
   The steering angle sensor records how quickly and how far the driver turns the wheel. Excessive steering inputs can indicate understeer, over-correction, or simply an improper racing line. Meanwhile, too little input through certain corners might reflect a conservative approach. Teams also watch for “sawing” on the wheel—frequent micro-corrections that might indicate a setup or driving-style issue.

5. Tire temperatures  
   While more relevant to setup changes and advanced differential tuning, tire data remains valuable for forging a consistent, well-rounded driver. Overheating or cold tires can hamper lap times and degrade race pace. By combing through corner-by-corner tire temperature data, the team can pinpoint if a driver is overdriving (overheating the fronts under braking) or under-driving (never getting the rears up to temperature).  

By prioritizing these reliable data points, AS Motorsport fosters a clear progression path for each driver. Engineers like Benjamin, Ruggiero, and Matteo guide the young talents with structured targets: “Add two more km/h in Turn 3,” or “Try to brake a meter later at Turn 6.” Such specificity is only possible because every aspect of the lap is documented in fine-grained detail.

<h2>Integrating data in daily operations</h2>

The synergy between driver, car, and telemetry extends well beyond practice laps. Within the AS Motorsport paddock, telemetry usage is woven into each day’s schedule—from early morning checks to post-session debriefs:

• Pre-session briefings: Before a driver heads out, the engineering crew sets targets based on comparing track conditions, fuel loads, and competitor data from prior sessions or prior years.  
• On-track monitoring: Thanks to real-time (or near real-time) telemetry, the pit wall can follow the car’s vital stats: engine temperatures, gear shifts, and more. If something looks amiss—say brake temperatures running too hot—engineers can radio the driver with cautionary advice.  
• Post-session analysis: Immediately afterward, driver and engineers gather around laptops to dissect the data. They overlay laps, scrutinize braking rates, examine mid-corner speeds, and discuss any anomalies.  
• Setup feedback loop: Telemetry also fosters a deeper feedback loop between driver and mechanic. If the team suspects the driver is complaining of understeer, the data might confirm that the front tires are overheating or that the rear wing setting is giving too much rear-end grip. Adjustments are then made to optimize the setup.  

This data-driven schedule unfolds repeatedly during test days and race weekends. An F4 outing at Monza, for instance, may include multiple 20- to 30-minute sessions. Each run is carefully logged. By the final session of the weekend, each driver might have an entire library of data to compare and distill. Over the course of the 2025 season, that library continues to expand with track-specific references, culminating in an enormous amount of knowledge for both driver and team.

<h3>Technique, technology, and teamwork</h3>

Race weekends are a whirlwind of activity: practice, qualifying, and races take place in quick succession. Telemetry ensures the combined efforts of the driver, engineers, managers, and mechanics are spent wisely. The team manager, Andrej, coordinates with engineers Benjamin, Ruggiero, and Matteo, ensuring the data is consistent across all cars. Mechanics Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan use that same stream of telemetry to ensure the car is running optimally.

Once the race begins, cause-and-effect relationships unfold in real time. If a driver locks up on corner entry, it shows up as a significant spike in brake pressure. If they exceed track limits, the line trace might deviate beyond the circuit boundary. Each piece of data clarifies how best to sequence improvements.

For example, if Sebastian Bach consistently struggles with the braking zones at Red Bull Ring, the telemetry might show a repeated pattern: stable approach, but releasing the brake pedal too soon. Armed with these objective measurements, coaches and drivers can craft new braking techniques, perhaps focusing on more progressive release or readjusting the brake bias. Next session, Sebastian tries the revised approach, with immediate feedback from the data. This cyclical pattern of effort, measurement, and adaptation embodies how a strong engineering-driven mindset accelerates driver development far more effectively than guesswork.

<h2>The role of test days and continuous learning</h2>

While race weekends showcase a driver’s skill under pressure, test days are where deeper learning occurs. AS Motorsport’s structured test days at circuits like Vallelunga and Cremona provide up-and-coming talents the runway to make mistakes, run consistent laps, and interpret the data in a lower-stakes environment.

Many young drivers from karting find the shift to F4 daunting because of the sheer complexity—slick tires, aerodynamic grip, and heavier cars that react differently under braking. Telemetry, combined with hands-on coaching, smooths that transition. When a new driver climbs into the cockpit for a €6,000 test day, they gain exposure not just to the raw power of a single-seater but to the full suite of engineering support that can shape them into a professional racer. Detailed post-run data analysis, individualized coaching, and direct comparisons to benchmark laps show them where they stand.

Additionally, these test days serve as a perfect proving ground for advanced amateurs who dream of dabbling in professional motorsport. Rather than indulging in a single hot-lap experience, participants engage in genuine performance improvement sessions. Using real-time telemetry from their laps, they can literally see themselves getting quicker throughout the day. It is a microcosm of how a professional driver develops over a season—just condensed into a single day of learning.

<h3>Comparing laps with the pros</h3>

One highlight of an AS Motorsport test day is comparing your lap to a reference set by a professional. Overlays of speed traces, throttle modulation, and braking patterns are the ultimate instructor. If the professional driver consistently carries higher mid-corner speeds in Turn 2, the amateur can pinpoint exactly how they gained that advantage: Did they brake later, release earlier, or maintain a more optimal line?

This immediate and visual representation of the performance gap fosters a clear training objective for each corner. Instead of vague advice (“Carry more speed”), the data reveals: “Maintain your brake pressure slightly longer, then pick up the throttle more smoothly at apex.” This brilliant clarity shortens the learning curve dramatically for those stepping into the world of F4.

<h2>Telemetry shaping championship strategies</h2>

AS Motorsport competes across various championships in 2025, from the F4 Italian Championship—renowned as a global proving ground for future talent—to the Euro 4 Championship for a broader European stage, and the F4 CEZ that’s gaining momentum in Central Europe. Each circuit demands unique braking, gearing, and cornering techniques.

• Imola’s undulating layout punishes poor brake modulation and inconsistent corner entries. Telemetry exposes if a driver is off the optimal line or missing the apex by half a meter.  
• Monza’s slipstream-heavy nature shifts emphasis to exit speeds out of chicanes and minimal drag on straights. Speed traces are pivotal here, showing how every kph carried onto the main straight can set up crucial overtakes.  
• Mugello’s flowing corners require precision in throttle application and load management. Telemetry clarifies how quickly drivers transition from brake to throttle and maintain aerodynamic balance across the sweeping curves.  

In each scenario, data analysis directly influences how a driver and engineer approach both one-lap pace (qualifying) and long-run consistency (the race). By the time the team arrives for race day, they already have a well-honed plan based on telemetry gleaned in earlier practice sessions or from previous seasons. This method, combined with driver skill, results in podium finishes and a reputation as a front-running, development-focused squad.

<h2>The bigger picture: building complete drivers</h2>

Telemetry is transformative, but it does not exist in isolation. It is one pillar of modern driver development, complementing mental coaching, physical fitness, simulator practice, and track walks. When used in synergy, these tools make young drivers more adaptable, confident, and poised in the cockpit.

• Mental focus: Reviewing telemetry can improve a driver’s concentration by revealing exactly which laps displayed peak performance. This knowledge fosters better visualization techniques off-track.  
• Physical strength: Young drivers who see themselves braking inconsistently might work to strengthen leg muscles or refine their footwork to handle repeated high-pressure braking zones.  
• Strategic awareness: By studying fuel load effects or tire-degradation data, drivers can learn to pace themselves in longer runs, preserving race finishes rather than simply flying for one lap.  

AS Motorsport’s driver roster exemplifies this holistic approach. Andrea Dupe blends raw speed with increasingly sophisticated data interpretation skills. Mathilda Paatz relies on telemetry to refine her lines, bridging the gap from karting to formula cars in short order. Meanwhile, Sebastian Bach, who already tasted success as the Danish F4 rookie champion, uses advanced data comparisons to iron out the final inconsistencies in his race craft.  

Whether it is analyzing the friction circle after each session at Red Bull Ring or discussing throttle traces over lunch, data forms the bedrock of their learning. Instead of repeating mistakes or guessing how to improve, each driver can methodically climb the performance ladder, rung by rung, always guided by numbers that never lie.
