    <h1>Behind the scenes: how team spirit fuels our driver line-up</h1>

Team spirit is more than just a motivational phrase at AS Motorsport; it is the very foundation that supports our drivers and staff on their quest for perfection in Formula 4 (F4). Far from the bright lights and champagne showers at the podium, an entire world of collaboration, communication, and dedication unfolds in our workshop, at the track, and on every test day. Whether it is a first-year rookie or one of our rising stars, mutual trust and unwavering support help shape every lap time, every race strategy, and every victory. In this behind-the-scenes look at AS Motorsport, we explore how unity powers our driver line-up, creating an environment where talent thrives, confidence grows, and boundaries are constantly pushed.

In 2025, our team competes in a rich array of championships—from the Formula Winter Series (FWS) in Spain to the F4 Italian Championship, the Euro 4 Championship, and the F4 CEZ (Central European Zone). At first glance, the geographical spread and variety of these competitions may seem daunting. Yet, a closer look reveals a well-oiled machine: each championship venue is chosen carefully to give our drivers the right combination of experience, familiarity with different track layouts, and the pressure of top-level motorsport. Behind every logistical challenge stands a team with decades-long experience, blending the knowledge of staff who honed their mechanical and engineering skills in rally cars with newer specialists who arrived during our transition to single-seater racing. From the earliest days with Peugeot 206 S1600 in the Slovenian Rally Championship to the first official Formula 4 cars in Italy, we have carried forward one unbreakable principle: success comes from people—people who trust, respect, and uplift one another.

<h2>The role of synergy in F4 success</h2>

AS Motorsport’s history narrates a blend of technical evolution and determined progression. We began our journey in the mid-1990s when our founder, Andrej Slak, partnered with talented rally drivers in the Slovenian championship. As the team moved from rally to Formula Renault 2.0, and eventually to Formula 4, we carried forward the lessons learned at every turn, pit stop, and mechanical upgrade. Today, synergy between engineering brilliance and driver talent stands at the heart of our approach.

Walk into our workshop, located in Noventa di Piave, Italy, and you will be greeted by meticulous engineers, such as Benjamin (Engineer 61), Ruggiero (Engineer 62), and Matteo (Engineer 18). Each of them, with specialized F4 expertise, contributes to the setup and optimization of these modern single-seaters. They work alongside our mechanics—Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan—who transform theoretical car configurations into reality. Whether it is adjusting brake bias, interpreting temperature data, or changing gear ratios, everything comes down to open, efficient communication. When an engineer presents new telemetry findings, the mechanics spring into action, applying their hands-on skills to adjust rear wings, manage tire pressures, or implement brand-new Pirelli sets for upcoming test runs. This synergy ensures that the car you see on track embodies everyone’s best work.

Yet synergy in F4 success is not limited to purely technical aspects. Our team manager, Andrej, orchestrates logistical elements—transporting cars, planning test days, and scheduling race weekends—ensuring we are always prepared. Meanwhile, Julien, our “Team Booster,” fosters an upbeat atmosphere, encouraging our mechanics during long nights of preparation and lifting drivers’ spirits after a day of challenging laps. When the final green light appears on a race weekend, the entire pit wall—engineers, strategists, data specialists, and even the tire technicians—unite. There is a collective trust in the information flow from the radio to the cockpit, from driver feedback back to the data screens, and from the pit wall outward to the rest of the team.

<h3>Where mechanical precision meets personal connection</h3>

So, how does synergy truly translate into success for our drivers? It begins with forging personal connections. Each of our mechanics and engineers invests time to understand every driver’s individual style. For instance, Sebastian Bach (car number 62) joined us with a background as the Danish F4 rookie champion in 2024. Despite his prowess in handling hard braking zones, he initially struggled to find the right balance on banked corners at tracks like Barcelona. Engineer Ruggiero noticed that slight changes in the suspension setup could boost Sebastian’s confidence mid-corner, and mechanic Roc executed the adjustments seamlessly.

Along similar lines, when recent rookie podium finisher Andrea Dupe (car number 61) discovered he carried too much speed into Vallelunga’s tight hairpins, Benjamin recognized the potential for a different gear mapping. Meanwhile, mechanic Sale quickly learned what brake pad temperatures Andrea liked best for controlling the car’s rear. With close collaboration, they shaved tenths of a second off each sector. The slightest tweaks in mechanical parts, combined with real-time feedback from the drivers, led to major breakthroughs.

Our third official 2025 driver, Mathilda Paatz (car number 18), exemplifies how synergy can shape a young driver’s career day by day. Without any major championship titles yet to her name, Mathilda arrived at AS Motorsport eager to prove herself. The engineers noticed her knack for hitting apexes with remarkable accuracy, so they introduced data analyses aimed at making her more consistent in corner exits. In each test session, a collective spirit of improvement reigned: whether it was a small aerodynamic tweak from Matteo to stabilize the car under high wind conditions or the supportive presence of Julien, who helped Mathilda digest telemetry charts without feeling overwhelmed, synergy made all the difference.

<h2>Bringing out the best in each driver</h2>

Drivers might be the face of a motorsport team, but none of them excel without a crew of professionals supporting them behind the scenes. At AS Motorsport, “team spirit” means developing every driver as a well-rounded racer, focusing on racecraft, mental resilience, and technical understanding. This approach is vividly displayed in our test days, which function as a treasure trove of learning opportunities.

<h3>Test days: training ground for champions</h3>

We host our test days at two key circuits: Cremona and Vallelunga. Cremona, at 3.4 km, is ideal for honing essential F4 skills, thanks to its smooth design, helpful for practicing high-speed runs and accurate braking. The long straight provides prime conditions to test the acceleration of our single-seaters—something that excites novices transitioning from karting. Drivers experience first-hand the power of an F4 engine, along with the vital interplay between aero grip and mechanical grip.

Vallelunga, near Rome, offers a more technical layout that can challenge drivers with its intricate corners, changes in elevation, and varied braking points. When prospective drivers or young talents from karting show up for a test day, they receive not just a seat and a fast car, but a fully immersive experience in professional motorsport. Our engineers introduce them to telemetry tools, explaining how best to interpret speed traces and pedal positions. Mechanics walk them through basic maintenance tasks, so newcomers develop a respect for the car’s components. Meanwhile, coaches reinforce mental approaches, encouraging novices to stay calm under pressure and focus on consistency before raw speed.

For our official drivers, these test days are where incremental gains turn into unstoppable momentum. Sebastian Bach refines his approach to rapidly shifting track conditions, Andrea polishes his already remarkable braking technique, and Mathilda works on corner-exit precision. Every time they climb out of the cockpit, new data flows into engineers’ laptops, fueling discussions on ways to harness extra tenths or hundredths of a second. The synergy here extends beyond the car: a driver leaves the garage brimming with confidence, knowing that a tight-knit group has examined every detail, from aerodynamic settings to tire performance. As a result, each official driver, along with prospective newcomers, feels they have a supportive foundation to push their limits.

<h3>Exchanging ideas, creating champions</h3>

One of the most uplifting sights in the garage is witnessing the open exchange of ideas among drivers. Andrea might share his tips for late braking with Mathilda, while Sebastian might discuss how to find the best exit line on certain corners at Mugello. This culture is deliberately cultivated by the team: we encourage our young racers to treat each other as allies, not rivals. Yes, competition is fierce, but when it comes to data analysis or post-session debriefs, they learn more by pooling their knowledge. If a major race in the F4 Italian Championship looms, the drivers review relevant telemetry from prior sessions, dissecting improvements in real time—always with coaches and engineers acting as sounding boards.

That said, no synergy is complete without the presence of positive leadership. Andrej, as team manager, sets the tone: conversation flows both ways. Drivers are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and propose new approaches. Julien, the Team Booster, echoes that positivity, ensuring no driver ever feels singled out for mistakes. Instead, the entire group views each error as an opportunity to learn. For example, when an unfortunate spin at Imola cost Andrea valuable track time, the immediate focus was on deciphering the car’s handling dynamics and analyzing the driver’s inputs, rather than pointing fingers. The deeper their trust in each other, the more effectively they can bounce back from setbacks.

Communication goes beyond just the staff. Mechanics regularly speak directly with drivers about how the car responds on track, bridging the gap between the data-laden language of engineers and the real-world sensations of driving. Whether it is Lorenzo or Joan tightening a bolt or re-checking the alignment, each step is carried out with conviction that the driver feels secure and confident. Nothing fosters better synergy than the knowledge that each person’s role—big or small—contributes to team success.

From our earliest days, we understood that forging a “family” atmosphere is the best path toward building champions. This principle held true when we competed with Peugeot 206 S1600 rally cars in the early 2000s, forging relationships with drivers like Rok Turk and Georg Reitsperger. It remains true now, in the modern era of single-seater F4. Over time, we refined our technical arsenal and adapted to new challenges—evolving into a team that can seamlessly manage multiple championships across various European circuits. But the heart of our approach has remained constant: synergy, respect, and unwavering teamwork.

<h2>A collective drive through championships and history</h2>

Take a look at the 2025 season’s crowded calendar: the Formula Winter Series in Spain (Portimão, Valencia, Motorland Aragon, and Barcelona) is followed by Euro 4 events at Le Castellet, Mugello, and Monza, plus the F4 Italian Championship visits to Misano, Vallelunga, Mugello, Imola, Barcelona, and once again Misano for the finale. And if that seems like a lot, there is also our participation in the F4 CEZ Championship, featuring rounds at Red Bull Ring, Salzburgring, Autodrom Most, Slovakia Ring, and Brno. Each of these circuits has a unique character—from the high-speed straights of Monza to the sweeping corners of Mugello—and demands detailed planning for optimal results.

In preparing for such a jam-packed schedule, synergy emerges in how tasks are divided and executed. Some staff specialize in monitoring aerodynamic and tire data, focusing on the hot conditions expected at the Spanish circuits, while others optimize setups for traditionally cooler rounds like Red Bull Ring in April. Mechanics also rotate responsibilities so that no single person is overly burdened, ensuring fresh perspectives remain available for each race weekend. Meanwhile, each driver sets personal goals and works with coaches to develop race strategies consistent with the team’s broader championship aims. So, while Andrea might seek a podium in Mugello, Mathilda might aim for consistent top-ten finishes crucial for rookie points, and Sebastian might focus on maximizing a perfect set of laps in qualifying.

Through every moment, from the earliest setup day at the track to the late-night adjustments after a stormy free practice session, our staff remains in harmony. When storms appear mid-session, the engineers reevaluate the aerodynamic package, while mechanics swiftly swap to wet tires or adjust ride heights. Our drivers rely on that synergy. They know each mechanical tweak is the product of countless combined efforts. They trust that the data coming from the pit wall is accurate, and that the entire crew stands behind them, encouraging them to drive with confidence.

<div></div>

Our deep-rooted history also brings perspective and humility to each new challenge. We remember the old days of rally, drifting through gravel stages and fine-tuning gear ratios for different terrains. We recall the switch to Formula Renault 2.0, where, for the first time, aerodynamic grip demanded advanced analysis of downforce levels. Each leap in racing categories brought fresh sets of obstacles and learning curves, but also taught us that unwavering team spirit, the desire to collectively overcome, was just as valuable as raw speed. That belief remains the heartbeat of AS Motorsport.

<h2>From test days to the future: how we keep the spirit alive</h2>

Beyond championing synergy in daily routines and race weekends, we go the extra step by opening our doors to future talents. Our Formula 4 test days, priced at €6,000, provide an all-inclusive package that includes telemetry analysis, coaching, and optional add-ons like brand-new Pirelli tires and onboard HD video. Although these test days serve as an enticing entry point for karting graduates and motorsport enthusiasts alike, they also represent a foundational element in our ethos of unity. Why? Because the moment these aspiring drivers show up, they see how we practice what we preach. They experience the same synergy that has shaped champions: a staff ready to teach, encourage, and tune the car to bring out their best performance.

When a young driver arrives at Cremona Circuit for the first time, the synergy is palpable from the welcome briefing. Andrej explains the schedule, Benjamin and Ruggiero introduce the telemetry systems, and mechanics like Lorenzo show how to strap into the cockpit properly. Even the staff who are not on duty that day might stop by or appear via video calls, offering a supportive word. During sessions, coaches provide real-time feedback, often riding the pit wall or monitoring driver radio communications. After each run, the data is scrutinized collectively—any issue, be it braking too late or downshifting too early, is addressed tactfully. This ensures that even newcomers feel they are an integral part of the AS Motorsport family.

<div></div>

The true measure of synergy is how it endures through the ups and downs of a motorsport season. Mechanical gremlins happen, collisions on track occur, and sometimes weather postpones racing plans. Nonetheless, it is precisely in these moments that our united front truly shines. The staff rallies together, ensuring the car is back in pristine condition for the next session, or the next day’s practice. The driver receives unwavering support and guidance. Engineers update data models and strategize so that no disadvantage lingers longer than necessary. From the humblest test run to the biggest championship decider, we never forget that our success depends on everyone’s willingness to pull in the same direction.
