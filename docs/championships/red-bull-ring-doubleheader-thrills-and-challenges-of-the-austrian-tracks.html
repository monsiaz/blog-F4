Few events in junior single-seater racing capture the imagination quite like a Red Bull Ring doubleheader. In 2025, the F4 CEZ (Central European Zone) Championship is bringing its unique brand of excitement, skill, and high-level competition to this iconic Austrian circuit not once, but twice—on April 13 and May 18. For AS Motorsport, a team with a storied history and a burning passion for driver development, this doubleheader at the Red Bull Ring marks a pivotal moment in the season. It is a chance to learn, adapt, and excel over the span of two race weekends in quick succession. It also underscores the significance of this track in shaping future motorsport champions, as the Red Bull Ring’s challenging elevation changes, technical corners, and lengthy straights combine to form a proving ground like no other in Formula 4.

In this blog post, we explore why the Red Bull Ring doubleheader is such a defining event in the championship, the key challenges and thrills that await our AS Motorsport drivers, and how the entire team—engineers, mechanics, coaches, and drivers alike—prepares for this intense Austrian adventure.

<h2>The road to Spielberg: significance of the doubleheader</h2>

The Red Bull Ring is undeniably a major highlight in any racing calendar, and hosting two rounds of the F4 CEZ Championship in only a few weeks’ time intensifies the challenge. High-profile circuits like this not only test the performance of the car but also sharpen the mental and physical readiness of every driver. For young talents stepping into Formula 4, no journey to the pinnacle of motorsport is complete without conquering the Austrian rollercoaster that is Spielberg. The fact that it appears twice in the 2025 CEZ Championship schedule means each driver and each team must plan meticulously for a swift turnaround between the two events.

AS Motorsport approaches this doubleheader with great enthusiasm. Competing once at the Red Bull Ring is already an exhilarating experience—doing it twice offers tremendous insight and the chance to compare performance metrics from one weekend to the next. For a driver searching for that extra tenth of a second, the doubleheader is also about continuous improvement, from rookie mistakes made in the first race weekend to refined perfection in the second. The team can implement lessons learned—from tire management to aerodynamic tweaks—within just a few weeks. The synergy between engineer and driver becomes paramount, as any miscalculation on gear ratios or suspension settings can lead to a significant performance gap. Nevertheless, this is exactly what makes motorsport so enthralling: the never-ending quest for that optimal setup, the relentless push to the limit, and the thrill of returning to the same track to prove your progress.

The schedule, too, heightens the significance of these weekends. On April 13, when the series visits for the first time, teams will gather data and form an essential baseline. On May 18, exactly a month and change later, they will apply everything gleaned from the first race. For AS Motorsport, it is a golden opportunity to strengthen teamwork. Leapfrogging from one Red Bull Ring event to the next helps confirm the team’s adaptability and fosters trust among engineers, mechanics, drivers, and management. It is this synergy that forges strong results on track and shapes a driver’s confidence for future steps in their careers—potentially climbing up to Formula 3, Formula 2, or even one day Formula 1.

<h2>Conquering the layout: challenges at the Red Bull Ring</h2>

Originally known as the Österreichring and later the A1 Ring, the current Red Bull Ring layout boasts 4.318 km of track (2.485 miles) for the April round, often measured at a slightly different 4.2 km (2.610 miles) for the second meeting. Yet the essential character remains the same—steep elevation changes, a sequence of challenging right-handers, followed by tight hairpins that test slow-corner exit speed, and high-speed sections requiring precise aerodynamic balance. With the Styrian hills as a dramatic backdrop, the track is as picturesque as it is technically demanding.

For an F4 car, the Red Bull Ring places heavy emphasis on traction out of slow corners. After turn one, there is a long uphill climb, encouraging drivers to maximize their launch. Turn three (heavily debated as turn two in some track layouts, given its slight kink on the uphill) demands heavy braking and careful modulation of throttle on exit. Meanwhile, the middle sector emphasizes mid-speed balance and quick direction changes, while the final sector beats to the tune of aerodynamic flow and subtle track gradient shifts. One lap can be deceptively short, but it reveals a driver’s capacity to handle everything from hairpins to near-flat-out curves.

This variety offers an extensive education to budding talents like AS Motorsport’s trio of official F4 drivers: Andrea Dupe (#61, from France but based in Milano), Mathilda Paatz (#18, from Germany), and Sebastian Bach (#62, from Denmark). Each driver must confront the same corners yet interpret them based on their own driving styles. Sebastian Bach, for example, distinguished as the Danish F4 rookie champion in 2024, is no stranger to technical circuits. He thrives on flowing corners, but the Red Bull Ring’s tight hairpins and altitude changes may test his braking consistency. Conversely, Andrea Dupe, already a vice-champion in an OK karting category back in 2023, brings swift adaptation from a stellar karting background. And for Mathilda Paatz, this is the captaincy exam of sorts—finding her feet in F4 with a calm racing intelligence and a resolute mindset.

<h3>Approach to cornering and setup</h3>

At the Red Bull Ring, every corner is an opportunity to gain—or lose—tenths. F4 cars rely on accurate mechanical grip. Engineers like Benjamin (Team Engineer #61) and Ruggiero (Team Engineer #62) work closely with the drivers to finalize suspension geometry, rake, and aerodynamic settings. A car that rotates effectively through medium-speed turns may struggle in the slow hairpins, so there is always an engineering compromise. Meanwhile, Matteo, the team’s Engineer #18, focuses on giving Mathilda a balanced car that can instill confidence on corner entry—an especially critical factor for a driver seeking to build consistency quickly.

In planning for the doubleheader, adjusting the ride height and damper stiffness can make or break a weekend. The increased load while cresting the hill after turn one forces teams to carefully tune the car’s front-end grip, ensuring the driver doesn’t experience understeer as they crest the brow. Meanwhile, consistent braking is crucial at turn three, where the car goes uphill before a tight hairpin. While the front tires are heavily loaded, the rears can break traction if torque is not applied smoothly. Data from the first event on April 13 will be carefully examined, giving AS Motorsport an advantage by the time they return on May 18.

<h3>Data-driven strategies and racecraft</h3>

Racecraft at the Red Bull Ring is all about strategic placement. Straight-line speed matters for overtakes, but a good exit from the previous corner is equally important. The track harbors multiple heavy-braking zones, perfect for last-minute lunges or slipstream battles. As a result, collecting comprehensive telemetry is critical. Each driver’s every braking point, apex speed, and throttle application data are analyzed to spot both strengths and weaknesses.

Thanks to modern telemetry systems, which AS Motorsport employs at every race, engineers and drivers can compare sector times. If Sebastian Bach’s style is more aggressive on entry, he might gain time in the early part of a corner but risk losing exit speed. Meanwhile, Andrea or Mathilda might take a more measured approach, sacrificing initial corner speed for a stronger exit advantage. By layering telemetry data from each driver over references from prior sessions, the team can isolate exactly how and where improvements can be made. The goal? To methodically transform these incremental gains into tangible advantages under race pressure. And when the second race day at the Red Bull Ring arrives, the accumulated knowledge drastically impacts each driver’s approach to on-track battles.

Beyond the car setup, the doubleheader also emphasizes consistent mastery in racecraft, from handling rolling starts to coping with the unpredictability of traffic. F4 grids, featuring young talents fighting tooth and nail, can lead to fierce competition. But the Red Bull Ring also punishes overzealous moves—runoff areas and gravel traps are well-placed to catch a driver who has stepped too far beyond the limit. Judging the grip level, especially if conditions vary from April to May, requires razor-sharp focus. AS Motorsport’s coaching staff step in to guide each driver, emphasizing focus, spatial awareness, and calm execution whenever fighting for position.

<h2>AS Motorsport’s legacy and preparation</h2>

AS Motorsport did not emerge overnight. The team’s history stretches back to the 1990s, with its roots first planted in rally racing, then culminating in a decisive pivot toward formula competition. These decades of competition—from the hill climbs in Slovenia to rally successes in Croatia—instilled a rugged resilience. The team’s founder, Andrej Slak, co-drove in rallies in the early ‘90s before embarking on a mission to build a world-class racing team that fosters young talent.

Fast-forward to 2025, and AS Motorsport competes in F4 championships spanning Italy, Euro 4, F4 CEZ, and the Formula Winter Series (FWS). The move to single-seaters required forging a staff brimming with specialists. Engineers like Benjamin and Matteo, mechanics like Lorenzo, Sale, and Roc, and management figures such as Andrej (Team Manager) and Julien (Team Booster) create the bedrock of the operation. Each member contributes a unique skill set, be it mechanical know-how, strategic insight, or motivational leadership. Their collaboration is best illustrated by these demanding weekends at the Red Bull Ring.

For the Austrian doubleheader, the team invests heavily in testing and fine-tuning each F4 car. Test days, fundamental to driver development, allow the squad to replicate essential race scenarios. While the Red Bull Ring is not always available for open testing, the lessons gleaned from other circuits—like Cremona or Vallelunga—are applied to the Austrian layout. In the lead-up to the April 13 round, the crew meticulously checks engine mappings, calibrates gear ratios, and simulates race starts. As with most racing operations, time is short, so the entire workshop in Noventa di Piave, Italy, hustles to ensure every detail meets the highest standard. By the time the second race day at the Red Bull Ring approaches, the team has a wealth of data from the first outing. They return with fresh insights, new strategies, and unwavering motivation to outperform their initial results.

Despite the race-day tension, AS Motorsport firmly commits to fostering a family-like atmosphere. For them, motorsport is about passion, performance, and ambition. When adversity strikes—be it a gearbox failure or an unpredictable weather shift—mechanics spring into action with solutions, engineers refine strategies on the fly, and coaches bolster each driver’s confidence. This unity and depth of expertise have carried AS Motorsport through the many transformations chronicled in its history: from rallying a Peugeot 206 S1600 in the mid-2000s, to fielding F4 cars on major European circuits today.

<h2>Building future champions: driver development under pressure</h2>

The Red Bull Ring doubleheader plays a unique role in forging the next generation of racing talent. For Formula 4 drivers, especially those in their first or second year, the challenge of racing at a world-renowned circuit twice in quick succession absorbs everything a driver has learned up to that point. It is a crash course in adaptability: the April race reveals areas of improvement, the drivers study data, refine technique, then return to the same circuit to demonstrate tangible growth in May.

AS Motorsport’s approach to driver development is methodical. Real-world racing combines seat time with structured feedback. When they are away from the track, drivers consult onboard videos, look into telemetry comparisons, and even practice scenario-based exercises—visualizing overtakes, analyzing how to position the car in high-speed corners, or deciding the best corner exit speed to defend or attack. Driving one lap at the Red Bull Ring is one thing; building the mental fortitude to conquer it over multiple practice sessions, qualifying sessions, and two championship events is another. Over the span of that month between the first and second races, each driver is expected to transform weakness into strength.

For Andrea Dupe, the vice-champion in Italy’s OK 2023 karting category, these two race weekends in Austria are about testing the waters of advanced single-seater dynamics. He must harness his raw karting speed and refine it with the nuance of F4 car control. Meanwhile, Sebastian Bach, who has already tasted success as Danish F4 rookie champion in 2024, aims to solidify his status as a consistent front-runner on the European stage. Mathilda Paatz, new to the F4 arena, keeps her own ambitions in sight, focusing on smooth progression and harnessing the valuable seat time. Success at Spielberg, in whichever form it takes—podium, points, or improved racecraft—bodes well for their broader racing journey. After all, top-tier teams and sponsors often keep a watchful eye on how a teenage driver handles a circuit as prestigious and complex as the Red Bull Ring.

<h3>Leveraging test days for Austrian success</h3>

Although free practice sessions are somewhat limited during race weekends, test days remain an invaluable tool for bridging gaps in knowledge and optimizing a driver’s performance behind the wheel. AS Motorsport organizes specialized test days throughout the year, at circuits such as Cremona and Vallelunga in Italy. While these tracks differ in layout from the Red Bull Ring, they still allow the drivers to rehearse fundamentals—like braking technique, throttle modulation, corner entry precision, and data analysis.

At these test sessions, participants experience a full immersion in professional motorsport. Engineers, mechanics, and coaches simulate the focused environment of a race weekend, even if the track is less demanding than Spielberg. The same passion, the same drive to extract every ounce of performance, runs through the entire operation. With each test day, a driver becomes more adept at communication, conveying handling feedback to engineers, and picking up on the data readouts from advanced telemetry. This same synergy proves indispensable at the Red Bull Ring, where the slightest difference in track conditions—from cooler mornings in April to potentially warmer afternoons in May—can necessitate mid-session car setup changes.

Moreover, these test sessions serve as a stepping stone where a young racer transitions from karts, experiences the power of an F4 machine, and gradually builds the confidence necessary to excel in official championship rounds. The Red Bull Ring doubleheader is then the place to reap the benefits of such thorough preparation. If a driver has learned to keep calm while adjusting lines, gear shifts, and braking markers on a test track, that composure translates seamlessly into the weekend’s cutthroat environment.

<h2>A roaring conclusion: forging victory and inviting you along</h2>

With two Austrian races back-to-back, the 2025 season’s storyline is poised for a dramatic arc. F4 racing at the Red Bull Ring exemplifies the fierce battles that define junior formulas, the intricacies of modern data-driven motorsport, and the unstoppable ambition of teenage drivers itching for the next rung on the motorsport ladder. For AS Motorsport, these weekends are more than just two stops on the calendar; they represent a bold statement of the team’s resolve to compete intensively, glean the maximum from each session, and champion the growth of their young talents.
