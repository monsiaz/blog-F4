    <h1>F4 cez explored: the rising star of central european motorsport</h1>

The world of Formula 4 racing has expanded dramatically over the last decade, with new championships taking root in different corners of Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Yet one series, in particular, is currently capturing the imaginations of drivers, teams, and fans alike: the F4 CEZ (Central European Zone) Championship. While it might lack the longstanding reputation of the Italian or German F4 series, F4 CEZ is quickly proving to be an unmissable event on the junior racing calendar. This championship fuses high-level competition with cost-efficient racing, making it a prime destination for talented up-and-comers.

At the forefront of this explosive growth in the F4 CEZ stands AS Motorsport, a team that exemplifies the ambition, passion, and commitment to driver development so essential in single-seater racing. Having cut their teeth in rally, Formula Renault, and various F4 championships, AS Motorsport has built a solid foundation for success in Central Europe. The team’s commitment to high-end engineering, professional coaching, and a family-like atmosphere provides a compelling environment for any young racer looking to make a name for themselves.

Though many fans once considered Central Europe a minor fixture in the global motorsport landscape, the F4 CEZ has given this region a chance to shine. Competitive grids, iconic circuits, and a well-structured calendar make it an ideal stepping stone into higher formulas, including FIA Formula 3 and beyond. Colliding stories of young drivers, storied race venues, and dedicated teams all converge, resulting in one of the most intriguing junior series anywhere in Europe.

In this blog post, we delve into the factors driving F4 CEZ’s meteoric rise, the challenges and excitement of the 2025 season, and how AS Motorsport nurtures future champions. We also explore how test days and driver development programs help aspiring racers unlock their potential. Ultimately, we discover why F4 CEZ is more than just another racing championship: it is a crucible in which tomorrow’s stars find their mettle.

<h2>Why F4 CEZ is making waves in the racing world</h2>

Central Europe has always had a strong culture of automotive engineering and motorsport passion.

Its approach is straightforward: offer world-class technical support and a clear, cost-effective path for new entrants to single-seater racing under the FIA’s widely recognized F4 ruleset.

Compared to other F4 series, F4 CEZ stands out for the diversity of its venues. Tracks like the Red Bull Ring, Salzburgring, Slovakia Ring, and Brno challenge drivers in unique ways. The Red Bull Ring, with its dramatic changes in elevation, tests a driver’s ability to adapt to shifting gradients, while Salzburgring’s fast curves emphasize precision and commitment. Slovakia Ring’s technical sections stress consistency and racecraft, and Brno’s flowing corners reward an in-depth understanding of racing lines.

In 2025, the F4 CEZ returns once again to these circuits, solidifying the championship’s reputation for delivering thrills to both participants and spectators. More than just high-speed action, though, the series has become an incubator for young drivers eager to move on to Formula Regional, Formula 3, and even higher. Some drivers, freshly joining from top-level karting, relish F4 CEZ as a gateway to simultaneously gain wheel-to-wheel experience and refine advanced driving techniques. The constructive competition among up-and-coming talents pushes the entire field forward, ramping up the standard of driving each year.

Beyond the on-track battles, the F4 CEZ fosters relationships across national borders. With Austrian, Czech, Slovak, and occasional Croatian events in the mix, the championship has a distinctly multicultural feel. Fans love the blend of local heroes and international prospects, as they resonate with the idea of championing young talents who have the potential to become the next big thing in motorsport. This synergy of environment, driver growth, and competitive spirit is precisely why F4 CEZ is now on the map as one of the most vibrant junior formulas in the world.

<h3>A strong heritage</h3>

Even though the F4 CEZ is a relatively recent addition to the global motorsport calendar, it draws on Central Europe’s centuries-old passion for engineering and motor racing. Countries in this region have hosted Grand Prix, hill climbs, and rallies that date back to the era of early motoring. From the Tatra and Škoda offerings to Austria’s illustrious ties to Formula 1, the region’s automotive heritage runs deep. Rally racing thrived in areas like Slovenia and Croatia, with local teams honing their craft and building a reservoir of mechanical expertise.

AS Motorsport’s own story is inseparable from this tradition. Founded by team manager Andrej and developed alongside skilled engineers and mechanics, the team got its start in rally, running cars like the Peugeot 206 S1600 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evo. Over the years, AS Motorsport scaled the ranks, taking on hill climbs, rally championships, and eventually moving toward circuit racing with their first Formula Renault 2.0. The variety of motorsport disciplines in which they competed enriched the team’s expertise and stoked a passion for discovery and innovation.

When the FIA introduced Formula 4 as a standardized entry-level open-wheel category, AS Motorsport saw an opportunity to focus on driver development in the single-seater scene. Their comprehensive approach—technical excellence fused with rigorous coaching—was an instant alignment with the F4 concept: giving young drivers a cost-effective but highly competitive training ground. Fast-forward to 2025, and AS Motorsport is now at the cutting edge, leveraging its storied history in rally and circuit racing to excel in major F4 championships, including the thriving F4 CEZ.

<h2>The 2025 F4 CEZ calendar: a closer look</h2>

The 2025 F4 CEZ season promises an array of unforgettable weekends, scheduled at six iconic venues across Central Europe:

• Red Bull Ring (Austria) – April 13, 2025.  
• Red Bull Ring (Austria) – May 18, 2025.  
• Salzburgring (Austria) – June 1, 2025.

Salzburgring challenges both horsepower and bravery. Renowned for its sweeping corners and scenic backdrops, it is a track that punishes mistakes harshly and rewards meticulous setups. The transition to Autodrom Most in the Czech Republic ensures a contrast, as drivers must adapt to a combination of fast straights, tight chicanes, and sharper angles. Slovakia Ring offers a different flavor of layout, featuring dynamic changes in elevation and a long course length of 3.688 miles—one of the lengthiest on the F4 CEZ calendar. Finally, Brno closes out the championship, an iconic circuit known for its fluid corners and considerable elevation changes.

Beyond the adrenaline rush, the progression from one round to another is a practical training sequence. Engineers and mechanics, like those at AS Motorsport, must constantly adapt setups to different track characteristics, gleaning insights from myriad data points along the way. For young drivers, the schedule builds confidence and experience with each passing round. While many fans focus on the glory of a race win, the subtle improvement in racecraft and consistent seat time are equally important building blocks for the next level of competition.

<h3>Meet the 2025 AS Motorsport F4 drivers</h3>

AS Motorsport’s 2025 driver lineup reflects the team’s unwavering dedication to scouting and nurturing fresh talent. The three official drivers, each born in 2008, illustrate how Formula 4 is a critical bridge between karting and higher formulas:

• Andrea Dupe (Car #61, FR, born July 12, 2008). Vice-champion of the OK Karting series in Italy in 2023, Andrea brings a mix of aggression and finesse to the track. Known for his fast learning, he already secured rookie podiums in past F4 outings.  
• Mathilda Paatz (Car #18, DE, born August 1, 2008). Hailing from Köln, she is new to the formula car world but has shown a remarkable affinity for set-up feedback and race pace. Her calm approach combines well with a deep determination to succeed in high-pressure moments.  
• Sebastian Bach (Car #62, DK, born June 4, 2008). The 2024 Danish F4 rookie champion joins AS Motorsport for a fresh challenge in F4 CEZ, hoping to replicate his early successes and refine his racecraft on legendary Central European circuits.

Having a trio of equally hungry racers keeps the entire squad on its toes.

The test day begins with an in-depth introduction from the mechanics and engineers, covering safety protocols, the specifics of F4 machinery, and best practices for track driving. Once helmets and suits are fitted, participants take to the circuit—either the Cremona or Vallelunga Circuit in Italy, locations chosen for their safe layouts and FIA-homologated surfaces. Laps are broken into sessions, and after each session, drivers return to the pits for a debrief and data analysis. Engineers use telemetry to compare sector times and highlight areas needing improvement, such as braking points, turn-in angles, or acceleration phases. This closed-loop learning cycle dramatically refines skills in a compressed timeframe.

Performance is then validated in further runs. Each subsequent stint sees the driver incorporate adjustments and glean new insights about line choice, car handling, and racecraft. By the end of the day, participants typically make quantum leaps in pace and consistency, building confidence in their ability to operate a single-seater at a competitive level. AS Motorsport’s staff remain eager to offer guidance, mindful that many test day participants become official drivers in the near future. This supportive path stands at the core of the team’s philosophy: from pure enthusiast or promising karter to full-fledged competitor, each driver’s journey is a story that AS Motorsport takes pride in shaping.

Ultimately, test days help prospective drivers gain clarity on whether they’re ready to commit to a full season of competition—be that in F4 CEZ or championships like the F4 Italian Championship, Euro 4 Championship, or the popular Formula Winter Series. The variety of championships in which AS Motorsport competes demonstrates that there is a perfect stepping stone for every driver. Some find the intense environment of F4 Italia beneficial, while others may prefer to sharpen their techniques in the F4 CEZ’s challenging but more cost-friendly environment. By offering seat time and professional insights throughout these test days, AS Motorsport ensures each driver can make informed decisions about the next steps.

As F4 CEZ continues to flourish, the demand for high-caliber teams with proven test and race programs also rises. AS Motorsport meets this demand by blending their family-style ethos with professional-level standards. This dual identity resonates with drivers and their support networks, making it easier for them to trust their potential to a team that values both performance and personal growth. Over the coming seasons, many more talented racers are sure to pass through these cockpit doors, spurred on by the dream of rising through the motorsport ranks all the way to the pinnacle: a seat in FIA Formula 1.
