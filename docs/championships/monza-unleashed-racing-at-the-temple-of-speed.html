    <h1>Monza unleashed: racing at the temple of speed</h1>

<p>
Few circuits in the world command the reverence and awe that Monza does. Nestled in the picturesque parklands near Milan, this high-speed wonderland has earned the nickname “the temple of speed” for good reason. Home to legendary battles, record-breaking laps, and moments of motorsport history that will echo through time, Autodromo Nazionale Monza is a track where drivers test the limits of both their cars and their own bravery. From the roars of historic Grand Prix machines to the new generation of single-seaters, Monza has always been a proving ground for aspiring champions. 
</p>

<p>
At AS Motorsport, our passion for racing is part of our DNA—a passion built upon decades of experience transitioning from rally championships to modern Formula 4 (F4) campaigns. As the 2025 season unfolds, there is no grander stage than Monza to showcase pure speed, technical prowess, and the determination of our young talents. This circuit’s long straights allow F4 drivers to experience the thrill of slipstreaming at speeds they’ve only dreamed of in their early karting days, while its iconic corners provide a masterclass in precision driving. 
</p>

<p>
For the F4 Italian Championship, Monza marks a critical juncture in the calendar. Set for June 22, 2025, this round represents not only a chance to seize valuable points but also a personal battleground where every young driver tests their skills in front of some of motorsport’s most passionate fans. The top European talents gather to see who can tap into every ounce of performance, trusting their engineers, their race craft, and often their instincts. Despite the pressure, there’s a sense of romance in racing at Monza—an intangible feeling that you’re part of something bigger, a lineage that stretches back over a century. In F4, that sentiment isn’t lost. Even stripped of the horsepower of higher formulas, the close fights, slipstream duels, and wheel-to-wheel drama demonstrate that Monza’s magic is alive in every racing category.
</p>

<h2>The legendary Monza circuit</h2>

<p>
Established in 1922, Monza holds a storied place in motorsport. Its venerable layout has evolved but continues to preserve the essence of speed that made it famous. Today, this circuit spans 5.793 kilometers (around 3.600 miles) for the F4 Italian Championship configuration, featuring famous sections like the Rettifilo Tribune, the Variante del Rettifilo, and the Parabolica curve. While the banked oval of the early years is now a relic of the past, the current track still demands finesse. Drivers approach the Rettifilo chicane at top speed, smashing the brakes and downshifting violently, navigating the tight left-right sequence that sets the tone for the entire lap. 
</p>

<p>
Monza’s history resonates with every gear shift. Some corners stand just as tall in legend as the drivers who conquered them. The Curva Grande demands a fearless entry, taking advantage of the aerodynamic grip (limited though it may be in an F4 car) and searching for the perfect line that balances momentum and tire conservation. The Lesmos, with their subtle cambers and quick approaches, provide a challenge where confidence in the car’s setup is everything. The Ascari chicane, named after the iconic Alberto Ascari, is an unforgiving trio of turns that can be a brilliant overtake opportunity or the site of heartbreak for those who misjudge their braking point. And finally, the Parabolica, a sweeping right-hander leading onto the start-finish straight, tests the driver’s nerve lap after lap. These are corners that reward balance, traction, and a firm commitment to pedal-to-the-floor, forging champions who are unafraid to push the boundaries of what’s possible.
</p>

<h3>slipstream battles and chicanes</h3>

<p>
Long straights at Monza may appear deceptively simple on paper, but in reality, they become a chessboard for slipstreaming. In Formula 4, where aerodynamic wake is less extreme than in higher formulas, staying glued to the gearbox of the car ahead unlocks incredible advantages down these straights. Races often become intense, multi-car battles where the overtaking possibilities multiply as soon as a driver finds a good draft. The challenge then transitions into late braking duels into the chicanes, giving us the very essence of Italian racing theatre. 
</p>

<p>
At Monza, every passing maneuver must be calculated with razor-sharp accuracy. Ill-timed lunges risk expensive damage, or worse, ruinous retirements. Yet for the bravest, the payoff is spectacular: the chance to gain a position on a circuit steeped in glory, with the crowd urging you on. For fans in the grandstands—and for those following from home through on-board footage—these passing attempts capture the heart of open-wheel competition. AS Motorsport’s approach to racing here is shaped by rigorous data analysis, aerodynamic optimization, and a well-honed strategy, providing our drivers with a car that handles the track’s high-speed demands while maintaining cornering stability. We live for moments where slipstream battles become near photo-finishes, all set against the backdrop of thunderous cheers in the stands. That is how legends are made at Monza.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, events in 2025 also extend beyond the F4 Italian Championship. The Euro 4 Championship will descend upon Monza on October 26, later in the season, and it’s yet another occasion for AS Motorsport to test the progress of our driver lineup. Whether it’s the spring, summer, or autumn, one thing remains consistent: Monza’s challenges demand exacting precision. Tire wear management, braking consistency, and an error-free approach to the chicanes each become pivotal to securing top results. For any up-and-coming driver with aspirations to climb the racing ladder, a strong Monza performance looks fantastic on the resume. This track transcends ephemeral glory; it bestows a sense of belonging to a cherished circle of drivers who’ve tested their mettle here and thrived.
</p>

<h2>chasing glory with as motorsport</h2>

<p>
AS Motorsport’s commitment to nurturing fresh talent forms the cornerstone of our presence in Formula 4. From our earliest days in rallying—where we first made a name for ourselves with Peugeot 206 S1600 machines—to transitioning into Formula Renault 2.0 cars and then F4 machinery, we have always believed in the power of development programs. The heart of this philosophy beats strongly through every member of the team. Led by Team Manager Andrej, alongside Julien—our Team Booster—and assisted by an engineering roster that includes Benjamin (Engineer 61), Ruggiero (Engineer 62), and Matteo (Engineer 18), we stand united in pursuit of innovation and peak performance. 
</p>

<p>
That spirit of collective professionalism extends to the meticulous work of our mechanics: Lorenzo and Sale on car #61, Roc and Marco on #62, and Roberto and Luca on #18, all supported by Joan’s all-round expertise. Each crew member plays a vital role, whether it’s adjusting brake bias or perfecting pit-lane procedures—even if pit stops don’t define F4 quite like bigger categories. This synergy also shapes how we prepare for events at Monza, refining ways to squeeze out every last tenth of a second while ensuring reliability under grueling conditions. 
</p>

<h3>the final push for championship success</h3>

<p>
Our three main drivers in 2025 embody the aspiration and daring that healthy F4 competition fosters. Car #61 is piloted by Milan’s own son, French-Italian driver Andrea Dupe, vice-champion in Italy’s OK karting in 2023. Highly motivated to shine on home soil at Monza, Andrea will be looking to convert his local familiarity—the sights, the atmosphere, the corners—into a competitive edge. On car #18, German driver Mathilda Paatz from Köln aims to continue her steady progression by tackling the famed Temple of Speed. For her, developing the art of slipstreaming is priority number one, given Monza’s unique demands. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, car #62 is in the skilled hands of Denmark’s Sebastian Bach, the 2024 Danish F4 rookie champion, now stepping onto Italy’s biggest stage. Each driver brings a distinct presence, skillset, and background, but they share an unwavering determination to maximize the weekend. They rely on the synergy that marks AS Motorsport’s ethos: deep telemetry analysis, cohesive setups, real-time feedback, and a familial team atmosphere. If a driver is pushing flat-out on the last lap, hunting for that podium or top-five finish, the entire squad stands behind them, cheering and providing the technical spine that supports every thrilling overtake or defensive stand.
</p>

<p>
In pursuit of this success, AS Motorsport leverages the invaluable progress gained during test days. Even though Monza’s unique layout can’t be precisely replicated on other circuits, practice sessions at venues like Cremona and Vallelunga help drivers adapt to high-speed corners and heavy-braking zones. Our F4 test program—open to up-and-coming talents—underscores the importance of seat time, coaching, and data interpretation. Drivers refine their skills, learning to modulate the brakes for cleaner entries and adjusting their lines for better apex speed. With staff engineers and mechanics on hand to deliver insights, each test day is a mini-laboratory where drivers learn racecraft fundamentals that will help them spiritualize Monza’s demands. It’s not just about top speed in a single lap, but about harnessing race pace, endurance, and mental resilience—qualities that define the best racing drivers.
</p>

<p>
In the heat of an F4 season, Monza is an apex challenge that leaves little room for error. The approach to each chicane is a test of fortitude and skill, where a driver must perfectly time braking references that shift with tire wear and fuel load changes. The exit from the final Parabolica corner can make or break a lap, setting the tone for a slipstreaming showdown on the main straight. Within that high-stakes environment, the camaraderie of AS Motorsport’s engineers, mechanics, and management remains unshakeable. Everyone knows that a strong showing at Monza can vault a team from midfield contenders to legitimate championship threats. But fortunes can change beneath the tall, leafy trees—mechanical gremlins, incidents in the first chicane, or simply a misplaced braking point—reminding us of how quickly racing’s pendulum can swing. 
</p>

<p>
AS Motorsport has witnessed the transformation of young talents who find their confidence blossoming amid Monza’s storied asphalt. It’s the realization that you are racing in a cathedral of motorsport, against the toughest competition, with an audience that appreciates every overtaking maneuver, every defense, every near miss. The synergy of dedication, skill, and a bit of risk-taking is what truly flourishes here. It’s a testament to why over the decades, from rallying successes to formula exploits, we’ve always kept our eyes on that next major race at Monza. The intensity, the expectation, the synergy of driver and machine—this is the essence of what it means to race in F4 and beyond. 
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the greatest allure of Monza is that it is bigger than any one driver or team. When you power down the start-finish straight, engine wailing at the limiter, you become a small part of a century-long saga of motorsport brilliance. For our drivers, the learning curve is steep, but the rewards are monumental. For AS Motorsport, it’s another milestone in our mission to cultivate the next generation of champions. From the rally stages of our past to the cutting-edge single-seaters of our future, we’ve learned that the thirst for speed never wanes—it only evolves. 
</p>
