    <h1>Braking systems 101: gaining those crucial tenths on corner entry</h1>

For any driver aiming to excel in Formula 4 (F4) racing, mastering braking technique and understanding the nuances of the braking system can be as vital as perfecting race starts or exit speed. At AS Motorsport—an international team known for nurturing young talent and pushing the boundaries of performance—engineers, mechanics, and drivers spend countless hours refining the art of late braking. Why? Because on a race track, shaving even a tenth of a second becomes the difference between standing on the podium or leaving empty-handed. In this post, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of braking systems, explore how AS Motorsport optimizes this crucial aspect of F4 cars, and demonstrate how a well-honed braking technique can land you valuable tenths on every corner entry.

We’ll also look at how the team’s history, their approach to driver development, and the insights gained from professional test days all feed into this singular goal: arriving at the corner faster, carrying as much speed as possible under braking, and emerging ahead of the competition.

<br/>

<h2>Understanding the fundamentals of F4 braking</h2>

In road cars, the braking system’s primary focus is safety and everyday usability. Most modern vehicles use anti-lock brakes (ABS), brake assist, and other driver aids to ensure that stopping is both straightforward and predictable. In F4, however, the story is completely different. The objective is achieving maximum deceleration in the shortest distance while maintaining precision. There are no fancy driver aids like ABS; it’s up to the driver to judge the threshold of lock-up and modulate pedal pressure accordingly.

The fundamental components of an F4 braking system include:
• Brake discs and calipers: Responsible for converting the car’s kinetic energy into heat energy through friction.  
• Brake pads: The friction-bearing surface that clamps down on the disc when the driver presses the pedal.  
• Master cylinders and brake lines: These transmit hydraulic pressure from the pedal to the calipers.  
• Pedal box and balance adjustments: Give drivers and engineers the ability to fine-tune brake bias between the front and rear axles.

At AS Motorsport, engineers like Benjamin (Team Engineer 61) and Ruggiero (Team Engineer 62) work closely with the drivers to ensure the pedal feel, brake bias, and system pressures are just right. Since each driver has a unique driving style, constant refinement happens—especially during test days in Cremona or Vallelunga, where the team collects data, compares telemetry, and finds the sweet spot for every individual behind the wheel.

<br/>

<h3>Embracing mechanical grip and aero</h3>

In the world of single-seaters, two key forces work to slow the car when the driver steps on the brake pedal: mechanical grip and aerodynamic downforce. Mechanical grip comes from the contact patch of each tire working against the track surface, dependent on tire compound, suspension setup, and weight distribution. Aerodynamic downforce, on the other hand, pushes the car onto the tarmac at higher speeds, enabling more aggressive braking without locking up the wheels.

• Early in a braking zone (when speeds are highest), aerodynamics significantly boost the car’s grip. This means a driver can apply more brake pressure immediately.  
• As speed decays, downforce diminishes, meaning the driver must gently reduce pressure on the pedal to avoid wheel lock-up or instability.

This dynamic balancing act calls for rigorous driver training. Young talents at AS Motorsport—like Andrea Dupe, Mathilda Paatz, and Sebastian Bach—spend countless hours practicing threshold braking, both physically in the car and in driver-in-the-loop simulators. The goal is learning how to taper braking force throughout corner entry, making use of the downforce at higher speeds and maximizing mechanical grip at lower speeds.

<br/>

<h3>Why brake bias matters</h3>

Part of optimizing corner entry is tweaking the brake bias. Brake bias means the percentage of braking force distributed between front and rear axles. The sweet spot depends on track conditions, driver preference, and even weather.

• Too much front bias and you risk understeer under braking, plus potential front-wheel lock-up if the track is cool or damp.  
• Too much rear bias raises the possibility of rear-wheel lock-up, causing oversteer that can spin you around in a heartbeat.

During championship weekends—whether in the Italian F4 Championship at Imola or in the Euro 4 Championship at Mugello—drivers often have to adjust brake bias session by session. Engineers like Matteo (Team Engineer 18) help interpret tire wear, track temperature trends, and data from practice sessions to fine-tune these settings. Getting it right can translate into consistent lap times and better overall tire management. Getting it wrong puts the driver in a constant battle just to keep the car stable.

<br/>

<h2>Optimizing corner entry for maximum performance</h2>

Braking is more than jamming your foot down and hoping for the best. The best F4 drivers break the act of braking into stages, each with its distinct role in controlling the car’s pitch and balance. The narrower the margin for error, the more a driver depends on data-driven refinements to stay competitive.

<br/>

<h3>The art of initial brake hit</h3>

The “initial hit” is that very first moment a driver applies the brake pedal. A firm, decisive press is crucial for tapping into maximum deceleration right away. But how firm? If the driver shocks the tires too abruptly, they risk a brief lock-up or jolt that unsettles the suspension. If they’re too gentle, precious tenths slip away.

At AS Motorsport’s test days, drivers quickly learn the value of calibrating that initial pedal press. Thanks to real-time coaching, onboard video, and advanced telemetry, coaches and engineers dissect the force applied in those opening milliseconds. Notably, the F4 test days at Vallelunga—where there’s a combination of fast and slow corners—demonstrate just how critical that initial braking phase is. By using advanced telemetry, the driver can see how quickly they reached peak deceleration and whether or not they sustained it consistently.

<br/>

<h3>Optimal trail braking and rotation</h3>

After the initial deceleration, experienced drivers transition into a technique called trail braking. Instead of maintaining maximum pedal pressure all the way to the apex, the driver gradually eases off, transferring weight back onto the rear tires at precisely the right moment for turn-in.

• Why trail brake? Done correctly, it rotates the car more effectively by giving the front tires additional load and therefore more grip to initiate a turn.  
• The driver’s job: keep the car balanced on the friction edge—neither pushing the front tires too hard nor letting the rear tires become too light.

At high-speed circuits like Monza—featured both in the F4 Italian Championship and the Euro 4 Championship—trail braking through fast chicanes can net major gains. Drivers who’ve successfully perfected it can brake later into corners like the Variante del Rettifilo, leveraging the dynamic load transfer to pivot the car. This is also where methodical brake bias adjustments—fine-tuned during free practice—come into play. If the driver finds the front end biting too hard, they might shift a small percentage of the bias rearward, and vice versa.

<br/>

<h3>Data analysis and driver feedback</h3>

During race weekends or official F4 Test Days, the final piece of optimum braking technique is the feedback loop between driver and engineer. Data acquisition systems track speed traces, brake pressure, steering angle, and more. Immediately after each session, drivers debrief with their engineer:

1. They review corner-by-corner telemetry: Are they carrying enough speed before braking? Are they hitting the brake pedal too abruptly? Is the pedal release smooth enough?  
2. They examine sector timings: Are they losing time on corner entry, mid-corner, or exit?  
3. They match everything against known references: The team’s “benchmark times” or even prospective improvements pointed out by the data.

This process is repeated over and over. For instance, if Andrea Dupe points out the car begins to understeer mid-corner when he tries to trail brake, the engineering crew led by Benjamin or Ruggiero might consider adjusting mechanical balance or altering the brake bias. Alternatively, if Mathilda Paatz notices she can’t brake as late as her teammates without lock-up, it might indicate that the pedal feel or front brake temperature is off, leading to an in-session fix.

<h2>Harnessing team expertise and history</h2>

AS Motorsport has come a long way since its roots in rally racing back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Over the years, the team has tackled everything from Peugeot 206 S1600 rally cars to Formula Renault 2.0 machines, eventually establishing a strong foothold in Formula 4. This diverse motorsport heritage gives the team a holistic understanding of vehicle dynamics—particularly the importance of braking systems.

The entire staff—from Team Manager Andrej and Team Booster Julien to expert mechanics like Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan—has seen the difference a strong braking performance can make. Whether it was setting up rally cars for tight hairpin turns on twisting mountain roads or preparing F4 cars to battle at high-speed circuits, a fundamental principle stands: precision and consistency in braking fosters better car control and, ultimately, better lap times.

AS Motorsport’s involvement in multiple championships, from the F4 Italian Championship to the Euro 4 Championship and F4 CEZ, also means the team faces diverse track layouts and conditions. High downforce corners at Mugello demand a different approach than the stop-and-go nature of Red Bull Ring. Each environment fosters the team’s development in braking optimization: brake disc cooling strategies, pad compounds suited for repeated heavy braking, and the car’s overall aerodynamic efficiency.

<br/>

<h3>Working with the AS Motorsport engineers</h3>

Benjamin, Ruggiero, and Matteo each have specialized tasks to ensure the braking systems are prepared for peak performance:

• Benjamin (Team Engineer 61) is all about precision and data. He meticulously reviews telemetry logs, looking for anomalies in brake pressure, analyzing how the driver is transitioning from maximum braking to corner entry.  
• Ruggiero (Team Engineer 62) plays a role in balancing mechanical setup—like suspension geometry—to match the driver’s braking style. A sharper turn-in might require slightly stiffer front suspension settings, so the driver can trail brake more aggressively without rolling the car too far.  
• Matteo (Team Engineer 18) often focuses on innovative solutions, pushing the boundary of what can be done within the regulations. Whether it’s slight shifts in brake duct design for improved cooling or new brake pad compounds, he’s there to make sure the car remains competitive over a full race distance.

Communication between engineers and drivers remains essential. Sometimes, the biggest gains come not from new parts but from adjusting the driver’s mental approach to a braking zone. Other times, small mechanical changes bring newfound confidence in the cockpit. It’s a constant evolution, one that helps shape AS Motorsport’s identity as a leader in driver development.

<br/>

<h2>Putting it all into practice: test days</h2>

One of the cornerstones of AS Motorsport’s approach is the dedicated test day program, open not just to team drivers but also newcomers looking to get acquainted with single-seater racing. These sessions, offered at circuits like Cremona and Vallelunga, provide invaluable seat time to practice braking technique under professional guidance.

• Ideal environment: No pressure of immediate race results, allowing drivers to hone threshold braking, experiment with pedal feel, and learn advanced techniques such as trail braking.  
• Personalized feedback: Engineers like Benjamin, Ruggiero, and Matteo dissect each lap, showing drivers precisely where they can brake later or how they can transition to the throttle a fraction earlier.  
• Professional data logging: The same systems used in official F4 races are available. Drivers receive brake pressure overlays, speed traces, and even side-by-side comparisons with established AS Motorsport drivers.

Test days are also a perfect validation method for mechanical improvements: If Lorenzo, Sale, or Roc have installed fresh brake calipers or tested new pad materials, it’s crucial to see how they perform in real-world conditions. This synergy between engineering, mechanics, and driving not only helps the pros, but also aspiring racers who are transitioning from karting or experiencing single-seaters for the first time.

From a cost perspective, the standard test day package includes everything from the car itself to detailed telemetry analysis, allowing a driver to fully immerse in F4-level braking techniques and broader race craft. Many new drivers use these sessions to see how their corner-entry performance compares to benchmarks established by Andrea Dupe or Sebastian Bach, who both have demonstrated skill in precise braking zones.

<br/>

<h3>Real-world examples from AS Motorsport championships</h3>

Throughout the 2025 season, AS Motorsport has embarked on multiple championship campaigns. Whether racing at the high-speed sections of Portimão in the Formula Winter Series or tackling tight corners at Misano in the F4 Italian Championship, successful corner entries have been a decisive factor.

• In the Formula Winter Series, drivers face cooler track temperatures, meaning brake warm-up and consistent compound performance can be trickier. Sebastian Bach, the Danish F4 rookie champion of 2024, spent an entire day at Portimão perfecting brake modulation. Engineers discovered he was losing tenths in the opening laps due to insufficient heat in the front rotors. After making small changes to brake ducting and adjusting pedal technique, Sebastian’s corner entries improved dramatically, yielding faster sector times.  
• At Mugello, which is known for its sweeping corners and elevation changes, Mathilda Paatz found she could brake deeper into turns like San Donato. With the help of Matteo’s detailed data analysis, she spaced out her brake release more gradually, using the car’s front-end load to rotate more effectively. The result? Improved lap times and a significant jump in qualifying positions.  
• Meanwhile, Andrea Dupe, coming off a successful karting career with a vice-champion title in Italy (OK 2023), found the step up to F4 braking both exciting and challenging. Direct communication with the engineering team was instrumental for him, and by the mid-season mark, Andrea had already secured two rookie podiums in different championships, credited partly to his confidence under braking.

These real-world examples underscore how crucial braking performance is across diverse track types and conditions. Each track is an opportunity to learn more about brake cooling, pad longevity, and precise pedal technique—elements that can truly transform driver confidence.

<br/>

<h2>Maintaining consistency and driving evolution</h2>

Braking improvements aren’t a one-and-done affair. A driver’s braking technique evolves over an entire racing season. AS Motorsport places enormous emphasis on consistency—staying calm and composed as the pressure of championship battles intensifies. By methodically working through each corner, analyzing video and telemetry data, and collaborating deeply with the engineering staff on mechanical settings, drivers keep growing. 

This cyclical approach—practice, data review, mechanical adjustment, further practice—mimics how elite drivers in higher categories refine their craft. It’s also why so many young talents see F4 as the perfect stepping-stone category—a place to learn advanced driving techniques like high-pressure braking within a controlled, well-regulated environment.

<br/>

<h3>Looking to the future</h3>

AS Motorsport is continually innovating. Part of the excitement for upcoming seasons involves exploring new brake materials and improved thermal management solutions that can handle repeated heavy braking without fade. The team also invests significantly in simulators, bridging the gap between real-world track time and virtual data analysis. This means up-and-coming drivers, even before turning a physical wheel, can practice corner entries and braking strategies at circuits like Barcelona or Red Bull Ring in a simulator environment that closely mirrors reality.

Meanwhile, the synergy with the mechanics—like Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan—ensures that every car is meticulously prepared, with the brake system at the center of attention. From the fluid used in the lines to the slight re-angle of brake ducts, each detail can add up to crucial tenths on corner entry.
