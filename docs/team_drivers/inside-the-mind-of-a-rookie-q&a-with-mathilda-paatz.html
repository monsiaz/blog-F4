    <h1>Inside the mind of a rookie: q&a with mathilda paatz</h1>

For young drivers across the globe, Formula 4 (F4) stands as a monumental step into the world of professional motorsport. Launched with the goal of nurturing talented racers and preparing them for the rigorous paths toward F3, F2, or even Formula 1, F4 combines cutting-edge engineering with intense competition. Every season, new hopefuls emerge, determined to prove their mettle against some of the fiercest junior drivers around.

AS Motorsport, an established F4 team known for its history of rally roots and continuous pursuit of excellence, has a knack for spotting exceptional talent. Their commitment to young driver development is evident in their meticulously planned test days, comprehensive driver coaching, and devotion to performance analytics. From its earliest beginnings in rallying, the team has ventured through multiple series, ultimately focusing on open-wheel competition. Over time, they honed every facet of the program—engineering, mechanics, data coaching, and beyond.

The 2025 season has proven to be a thrilling one for AS Motorsport. Their roster includes three official F4 drivers: the French-Italian star Andrea Dupe—already a vice-champion in Italian karting—Danish hotshot Sebastian Bach—a rookie champion in Danish F4—and, of course, the promising newcomer from Germany, Mathilda Paatz.

At just 16 years old, Mathilda has quickly garnered attention. Hailing from Köln, she represents a new generation of drivers who are hungry to learn and fearless enough to take on the challenges of motorsport. She may not boast the accolades or trophies that some of her peers do, but her sheer determination, combined with the unwavering support of the AS Motorsport staff, makes her someone to watch. In an exclusive interview, she takes us behind the scenes, revealing how she transitioned from karts to Formula 4, how she deals with pressure, and why she believes this is only the beginning.

Below, we dive into an in-depth Q&A, exploring Mathilda’s first impressions of F4, her bonding with the crew, the adrenaline rush of pushing a single-seater to its limits, and the lessons she has already learned in her initial outings.

<h2>A new era at AS Motorsport</h2>

When Mathilda joined AS Motorsport for the 2025 season, it was both a strategic and sentimental move for the team. Historically competitive in various championships—spanning from the F4 Italian Championship to the Euro 4 Championship—the team had a clear vision: identify the next generation of great drivers and guide them using every resource possible. Their robust lineup of engineers, including Benjamin, Ruggiero, and Matteo, along with mechanics such as Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan, is fully dedicated to fine-tuning every component of the F4 car.

Team Manager Andrej has been the nucleus of AS Motorsport’s vision from day one, while Team Booster Julien provides the motivational and logistical backbone. Mathilda’s inclusion in the driver roster showcases a standout balance: AS Motorsport believes deeply in synergy, and they have found in Mathilda the soft-spoken yet determined personality that enriches team spirit.

Before we jump into her personal experiences, let’s recall how F4 fosters driver growth. Each race weekend is a high-pressure environment: free practice sessions, qualifying, and multiple heats, culminating in critical championship points. The events span premier circuits such as Monza and Mugello in Italy, Barcelona in Spain, or Red Bull Ring in Austria—tracks that challenge drivers to balance aggression with control. Away from race weekends, drivers refine their craft during test days, perfecting driving lines, practicing race starts, and analyzing data.

On these test outings, Mathilda gained significant mileage at Cremona Circuit and Vallelunga—two venues where AS Motorsport organizes professional test sessions. Her introduction to single-seaters was thus a carefully curated experience. Below, she opens up about that transition and how she has adapted to the demands of F4.

<h2>Q&A: behind the visor with Mathilda</h2>

<h3>Q1: How did you feel making the jump from karts to F4?</h3>

Mathilda: “Initially, it felt like stepping into an entirely different world. In karts, everything is very raw—there’s constant contact, tighter turns, and shorter tracks. But in F4, you’re dealing with greater speed, sophisticated aerodynamics, and a heavier car that requires a nuanced balance of throttle and brake input. When I first tested at Cremona Circuit, I was slightly overwhelmed. It wasn’t just about going fast; it was about understanding how the car responds to load transfer, how aero grip influences corner entry, and how to trust the car’s capability. It took a few sessions—and quite a lot of data analysis with our engineer Benjamin—before I found my rhythm. Now, I can’t imagine driving anything else.”

<h3>Q2: What has been your biggest challenge so far?</h3>

Mathilda: “The mental side, unquestionably. Physically, I’ve trained for this moment for years—focusing on upper body, neck, and core strength. But in F4, things happen so quickly on track. You might be doing over 200 km/h, brake hard for a sharp corner, and in that instant, you need to be perfectly precise. One small mistake can ruin your lap or, worse, your entire race. I had to learn to keep calm under that pressure. During my first few races, every lap felt like a life-or-death scenario, but now I’ve learned coping strategies—like focusing on each corner’s apex, breathing properly, and trusting that mistakes are part of learning.”

<h3>Q3: Does the car’s technology make a substantial difference in your driving approach?</h3>

Mathilda: “Absolutely. One of the big differences between advanced karting and F4 cars is the volume of data you can access. AS Motorsport has top-tier data logging and telemetry systems that we use after every session. It’s not just about seeing lap times; we pinpoint braking points, throttle pressure, tire temperatures, and even track your steering angles. Our engineers, like Ruggiero and Matteo, really dive deep into this data. They compare my laps with reference laps set by more experienced drivers such as Andrea or Sebastian. That comparison can be brutally honest, but it’s the quickest way for me to isolate exactly where I’m losing or gaining time. Ninety percent of improvement in F4 comes from analyzing and applying that data.”

<h3>Q4: How do you collaborate with your teammates, Andrea and Sebastian?</h3>

Mathilda: “They’ve been extremely supportive. Andrea is more experienced in the Italian circuits—having raced in national karting and then in F4—so he often shares little tips about racing lines or how to handle track peculiarities. Sebastian has a calm composure that I find inspiring. He simply focuses on his side of the garage, sticks to his plan, and always has a methodical approach to studying data. We may be competitors on the track, but behind the scenes, we watch each other’s onboard footage to look for incremental improvements. That environment fosters open communication, which makes the entire team stronger. We push each other to do better, but it’s in a very positive way.”

<h3>Q5: Can you talk about your first race experience in the 2025 season?</h3>

Mathilda: “It was at the Red Bull Ring for our opening F4 CEZ Championship weekend. Intimidating would be an understatement. Standing on the grid, strapped into the cockpit, with the engine vibrating beneath me, I felt both excitement and nerves. My heart was pounding—partly from the responsibility, partly from knowing this was only the start of an entire season’s journey. Once the lights went out, everything happened in a blur: fighting for position, defending on corner exits, and ensuring I respected track limits. I finished just outside the points, but that first race taught me so much about race craft. My pit crew was incredible too—Lorenzo and Sale made sure the car was dialed in, and their reassurance calmed me down.”

<h3>Q6: How do you handle feedback from the team after each session?</h3>

Mathilda: “When you come into the pits, the first thing you want to do is talk to your engineer. I speak with Benjamin or Ruggiero, and we go through the data. They’ll point out a corner where I braked too early, or the sectors where I lost time due to inconsistent lines. Then there’s the mechanical side—maybe the brake bias was too far forward, or maybe the front wing angle needs adjusting. Feedback can be very direct, and sometimes it stings a bit to hear what mistakes I made. But I love it because it’s how I learn. We’ll then formulate a strategy for the next outing—maybe try a different approach into Turn 1 or adjust the tire pressures slightly. It’s this constant cycle of theory, practice, and reflection that keeps me captivated by motorsport.”

<h3>Q7: Have you taken advantage of the AS Motorsport test days, and if so, how have they helped you progress?</h3>

Mathilda: “Yes, definitely. It’s a major benefit to be able to test on circuits like Vallelunga or Cremona. These aren’t just simple track days; they’re structured to simulate race conditions, complete with professional engineers and coaches. In the morning, we do a detailed briefing—covering everything from set-up changes to calculating how the car should behave on used tires. Then we run multiple stints, each one followed by a thorough debrief. We may focus on starts, optimizing the lines around technical corners, or consistent mid-race pace. The cost is high, but the value is immense: you get a full day immersed in the environment of professional racing, which for a rookie like me is priceless. It’s practice with a purpose.”

<h3>Q8: Who or what motivates you the most as you develop in F4?</h3>

Mathilda: “It might sound cliché, but my family has been a huge influence. My parents supported me from my early karting days, driving me around Germany to race on weekends. Beyond that, I look up to successful drivers who went through F4 and made it to Formula 1. Seeing that trajectory makes me believe anything is possible if I work hard. Also, within the team, there’s a feeling of being part of a motorsport family. Everyone, from Andrej to team mechanics like Roberto or Luca, invests in my progress. That kind of support is extremely motivating. I also can’t discount the adrenaline rush I get every time I climb into the cockpit—it’s an indescribable feeling that drives me to push even harder.”

<h3>Q9: What are your goals for the rest of this season and beyond?</h3>

Mathilda: “For this season, the main objective is to keep improving and hopefully secure a few top-ten finishes, maybe even a rookie podium. I don’t want to place unrealistic targets on myself. Every race is another chance to fine-tune my techniques, and if the opportunity arises, I’ll definitely go on the offensive. In the medium-to-long term, I’d like to compete in F3 or F2. I’m realistic about the difficulty level—motorsport is incredibly competitive, and each step up the ladder demands significant sponsorship and personal growth. But I’m ready to face those challenges. This is only the beginning of my journey.”

<h3>Q10: Could you share a piece of advice for other young drivers hoping to break into F4?</h3>

Mathilda: “My biggest piece of advice is to be open-minded. Racing is as much about learning from mistakes as executing perfection on the track. Use data, listen to your engineers, and never let your ego block you from growing. Comparisons to teammates or other drivers are healthy if you use them to assess where you can improve. Also, test days aren’t just seat time; they’re a golden opportunity to replicate race weekends, gather data, and build confidence. Surround yourself with people who push you and support you. And finally, be prepared for the complexity of single-seater racing—it’s not just about burning rubber; it’s about evolving mentally, physically, and emotionally.”

<h2>Stepping into the spotlight</h2>

Mathilda’s journey is a microcosm of why F4 was conceived in the first place: to serve as that perfect blend of high performance and developmental structure.
