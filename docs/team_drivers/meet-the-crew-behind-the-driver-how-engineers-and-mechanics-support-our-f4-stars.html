<h2>Inside the world of F4: a team-centric approach</h2>

Bringing raw talent to the forefront in the highly competitive environment of Formula 4 requires a holistic team philosophy. At AS Motorsport, the team-centric approach took root during its early years in rallying, when founder and co-driver, Andrej Slak, helped drivers achieve significant success across Europe. Over time, the team transitioned from rally cars such as the Peugeot 206 S1600 to formula racing machines like the Formula Renault 2.0 Caparo car. Now, in our latest chapter, we put young drivers in F4 seats, carrying forward that same passion and unity that shaped our rally beginnings.

When a driver—be it a promising novice or an established racer—arrives at AS Motorsport, they’re immediately greeted by a structured system that fosters both mental and technical development. Our staff knows that in modern single-seater racing, a one-second gain is often made by refining countless details: driving style, data analysis, aerodynamics, mechanical grip, and communication. That’s why every driver is assigned a close-knit group of engineers and mechanics who work tirelessly to enhance the car’s performance, capture and analyze data, and push the driver to evolve their racecraft.

To illustrate this dynamic, consider our three F4 stars for the 2025 season:  
• Andrea Dupe (car #61), a lightning-fast Italian who secured two rookie podiums in previous seasons.  
• Mathilda Paatz (car #18), a determined German talent stepping into F4 racing with an open mind and a drive to excel.  
• Sebastian Bach (car #62), a Danish racer who already has a Danish F4 rookie championship to his name and is now looking to keep climbing the motorsport ladder.

All three know that speed on the track is made possible only through the ongoing support and expertise provided by the engineering and mechanical teams. From the first test day at circuits like Cremona or Vallelunga through full-season campaigns in the F4 Italian Championship, Euro 4 Championship, Formula Winter Series, or F4 CEZ, the integrated teamwork remains the underlying factor in each driver’s progress.

<h3>Precision in design and data analysis</h3>

Racing in Formula 4 demands that teams interpret large sets of telemetry and transform that data into tangible on-track performance. That is where our engineers truly shine. At AS Motorsport, lead engineers like Benjamin (Team Engineer 61), Ruggiero (Team Engineer 62), and Matteo (Team Engineer 18) each specialize in analyzing sensor readouts, lap times, braking points, cornering speeds, throttle application, and more.

• Benjamin is the man behind the scenes for car #61, bridging the gap between technology and driver feedback for Andrea Dupe. He examines real-time telemetry during practice sessions, noting anomalies that might arise in tire temperatures, brake performance, or aerodynamic behavior. Then, he collaborates with Andrea to adjust wing angles and mechanical settings, ensuring the car responds precisely to the driver’s style.  
• Ruggiero, working on car #62, has the tricky job of refining Sebastian Bach’s F4 machine. Sebastian’s proven his raw speed by claiming a Danish F4 rookie title, but stepping into the international arena requires even more methodical data crunching. Ruggiero tailors the car’s suspension, geometry, and differential settings so Sebastian can extract every last bit of performance from the tires when he’s pushing for those crucial tenths of a second.  
• Matteo, meanwhile, works closely with Mathilda Paatz on car #18. Taking a driver with minimal single-seater experience and guiding her to become a formidable competitor calls for systematic data interpretation. Matteo ensures that every piece of telemetry—throttle traces, brake pressures, steering angles—is shared with Mathilda in a constructive way. This approach lets her visualize how best to refine her lines, manage corner entry speed, and carry momentum through apexes.

Beyond adjusting the cars, the engineers are also teachers and mentors, providing each driver with interactive debriefings. By comparing their laps to reference laps from more experienced individuals, the drivers can see exactly where to brake a bit later, accelerate earlier, or carry more speed. The end result is consistently improved lap times and heightened confidence on race day.

<h3>Communication and synergy</h3>

Engineering in motorsport isn’t just about numbers on a screen—it’s about understanding a driver’s psychological and emotional needs in high-pressure scenarios. That’s why effective communication between drivers, engineers, and the rest of the crew is paramount. Here at AS Motorsport:

• Team Booster Julien often steps in as a high-level analyst who merges data with strategic insights, suggesting race strategies that encompass not just raw speed but also tire and fuel management.  
• Team Manager Andrej has the final say on big-picture decisions, using his decades of motorsport experience. He orchestrates the entire team, ensuring that each engineer’s approach remains compatible with the driver’s mindset and the collective objectives.

In this environment, the engineers carefully choose the language they use when relaying instructions, especially under the stress of qualifying sessions or mid-race radio communications. For younger drivers transitioning from karting, such as many who join us for test days, it’s vital that the complexity of data is simplified in a manner that feels approachable. Whether it’s selecting an F4 test day at Cremona or analyzing results from a more sophisticated circuit like Vallelunga, the synergy between driver and engineer is often the determining factor in success.

When driver feedback—“the car feels loose in Turn 3,” for example—meets an engineer’s interpretation of the data, precious seconds can be unlocked. The better the synergy, the smoother it is for the team to outline an actionable plan: adjust the anti-roll bar, soften the suspension, or tweak the front wing. As the driver’s confidence grows, so too does the team’s ability to squeeze every advantage from the machine.

<h2>The vital work of mechanics</h2>

If the engineering department is the brain of AS Motorsport, then our mechanical squad is unmistakably the heart and lungs. Mechanics like Lorenzo, Sale, Roc, Marco, Roberto, Luca, and Joan bring life to the race cars by ensuring they’re in top condition before the engine even roars. Their systematic approach to assembly, maintenance, and real-time problem-solving is the crucial link between concept and reality.

<h3>The daily routine in the workshop</h3>

Long before a race weekend or a test session begins, our mechanics are hard at work at the team’s base in Noventa di Piave (Italy) and Koper (Slovenia). They perform meticulous checks on each component—in Formula 4 cars, even a minor oversight in torque settings, fluids, or wiring can mean the difference between a podium finish and a disappointing retirement.

A typical day in the workshop features multiple stages:  
1. Vehicle teardown: Post-race or post-test, mechanics dismantle parts of the car to inspect for wear, cracks, or stress fractures.  
2. Clean and reorganize: Thoroughly cleaning ensures that even tiny issues like oil leaks or micro-cracks can be spotted.  
3. Component replacement: Parts have usage limits. Mechanics track mileage, replace what’s needed, and log each change so engineers can reference a detailed maintenance history.  
4. Reassembly: Meticulous torque settings and alignment checks are performed. Bodywork is refitted, and the seats, harnesses, and linkages are regulated to match the driver’s build and preferences.  
5. Simulation checks: Once reassembled, the car is often placed on a rig or tested for systems functionality, from the gearbox to the engine’s electronics.  

Throughout every step, a mechanic’s job is as much about craftsmanship as it is about speed and efficiency. Racing is unpredictable—if an engine problem emerges during a practice session, the mechanics must rectify it quickly but without sacrificing quality. Every bolt, every fluid line, and every sensor connection matters.

<h3>Trackside heroes: race weekend challenges</h3>

Though the workshop is where a majority of the mechanical magic happens, the race weekends themselves bring their own unique challenges. The noise, tight scheduling, and the pressure of seeing your driver in an intense qualifying session or mid-race pit stop can be immense. Under the leadership of the engineering crew, mechanics coordinate tasks such as:

• Tire changes: Selecting the right compound is only half the story. Juggling brand-new Pirelli tires or ones with controlled wear for strategic advantage is a central part of race preparation. During F4 test days, for instance, we might decide to add the optional brand-new Pirellis for a driver to experience maximum grip, while comparing lap times with used tires to gauge improvement.  
• Wing and suspension adjustments: Small changes can drastically affect vehicle handling. Mechanics have to quickly adjust front wing angles and spring rates—a job done in minutes but with major performance consequences.  
• Damage repair: Collisions or off-track excursions sometimes happen. The ability to rebuild a broken front wing, rectify suspension damage, or diagnose a tricky electrical fault in minimal time can save a driver’s weekend.  
• Rapid fueling and fluid checks: F4 doesn’t always involve refueling pit stops during races, but fluid checks in practice or prior to qualifying can be vital. Ensuring correct fuel weight and engine fluids is as important as everything else.  

The mechanics’ responsibilities extend beyond the track as they liaise with the truck drivers, manage spare parts inventory, and keep everything in order across multiple championships. In 2025, we’re competing not only in the iconic F4 Italian Championship but also in the Euro 4 Championship, the Formula Winter Series in Spain and Portugal, and the F4 CEZ (Central European Zone). Different circuits like Monza, Mugello, Imola, Red Bull Ring, or Barcelona each require unique mechanical setups—engine mapping, gear ratios, or ride height adjustments. The mechanics are key in optimizing the cars for every nuance of the track.

<h2>Bringing it all together: synergy for success</h2>

When AS Motorsport’s drivers light up the timing screens, it’s the culmination of countless hours of behind-the-scenes cooperation. Team Manager Andrej’s leadership ensures that engineers and mechanics each know their roles perfectly, while Team Booster Julien provides insights that shape overall race strategy. Together, they set the stage for a seamless flow of information from the data minutes after a practice session to the final checks before the green flag drops on Sunday.

That synergy is felt especially strongly during test days, which we offer to both aspiring racers and enthusiastic newcomers who want a taste of Formula 4. Our mechanics prepare the car thoroughly, engineers set up the data acquisition systems, and then the driver is guided through each lap with real-time feedback. After the session, engineers analyze telemetry and mechanics stand by to adjust tire pressures, check brake temps, or optimize aero elements. Through this repeated cycle of data-checking and immediate, hands-on correction, the driver experiences the sort of progress that can only happen in a fully professional environment.

This integrated approach is exactly why we emphasize that our test days go beyond mere track sessions. From the second you arrive until the final debrief, you experience a complete immersion in professional motorsport. You learn not only how to drive an F4 car at its limit, but also how to communicate with engineers and appreciate the mechanical intricacies that make these machines tick. Whether you’re taking that test as a stepping stone to sign a full-season contract or simply fulfilling a lifelong dream, the synergy among our crew is the common denominator that makes the day meaningful and transformative.
