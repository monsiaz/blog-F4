    <h1>Life on and off the track: a day in the life of as motorsport drivers</h1>

Few sports capture both the raw intensity and personal commitment that Formula racing demands. In Formula 4 (F4), success is not just about the driver’s lap time, but also the synergy of an entire organization working behind the scenes to create the perfect racing environment. At AS Motorsport, our passion for performance, ambition, and the development of young talent fuels everything we do—from pre-dawn warmups to late-night debriefs. But what does a typical day look like for an up-and-coming driver in our F4 program?

For many, motorsport exists purely in the realm of race weekends: screaming engines, flashing pit boards, roaring crowds, and champagne-soaked podiums. However, behind every lap record or carefully executed overtake lies a meticulously orchestrated routine off the track. From intensive physical training to mental preparation, from debriefing with engineers to meeting with sponsors, a driver’s day is far more than just the race itself. At AS Motorsport, we understand that greatness is built in the unseen hours. In that spirit, join us as we dive into the intricacies of a day in the life of our F4 drivers: 61 – Andrea Dupe, 18 – Mathilda Paatz, and 62 – Sebastian Bach. Along the way, we’ll highlight how our dedicated team of engineers, mechanics, and coaches supports these drivers, ensuring they can evolve into the next generation of racing champions.

<h2>A morning of preparation and passion</h2>

Nothing says “motorsport day” like the early-morning wake-up call. Before the sun even rises, each driver is already mentally in gear. They typically begin around 6:00 a.m., rolling out of bed and into a light warmup routine that activates the muscles they will rely on to keep the car under precise control later on track. The exercises often involve resistance bands, low-impact cardio, and stretching. While the routine may vary according to each driver’s preference—Andrea, who has a background in karting, prefers brief but high-energy stretching, while Mathilda likes a longer, methodical yoga session—it serves a singular goal: prime the body to handle the physical rigors of F4 driving.

By 7:00 a.m., they’ve arrived at the circuit or at a workout facility if it’s a non-race day. On an official test day, such as one at the Cremona Circuit (perfect for beginners due to its long straights and more gradual corners) or Vallelunga (a technical, FIA-homologated track near Rome), the atmosphere is charged with focus. Mechanics and engineers are already present, rolling out the F4 cars from the trailer and preparing the garage for the day’s sessions. The smell of fresh tires and the slight hint of fuel blends with the morning chill in the air, creating a unique ambience only those in the racing world truly appreciate.

Before stepping into their overalls, the drivers gather for a short briefing with the AS Motorsport staff. Team Manager Andrej leads the meeting, explaining the goals for the sessions, the expected track conditions, and any updates on the car setups. Next, Team Booster Julien typically offers logistical updates and motivational pointers, reminding drivers that every lap is an opportunity to refine racecraft. The drivers are then introduced to the engineering team: Benjamin (Engineer 61), Ruggiero (Engineer 62), and Matteo (Engineer 18). Each engineer specializes in analyzing their respective driver’s performance data, ensuring that any insights gleaned from the previous day’s runs or races contribute to improvements on the circuit.

<h3>Finding the perfect balance with the engineers</h3>

Even in F4—often considered the first rung on the ladder to the highest levels of motorsport—extracting maximum potential from the car demands precise adjustments. The power, braking capabilities, and aerodynamic package of a modern single-seater are incredibly sensitive to even the slightest changes in track temperature or tire condition. That’s why each driver sits down with their engineer to discuss strategy prior to the first session of the day. They analyze telemetry from prior outings, comparing data on braking points, throttle application, steering angles, and sector splits. The goal is not simply to drive “flat out,” but to find a lap time advantage through smooth, consistent inputs.

For Andrea, who is fresh off being a Vice-champion in Italy in the OK 2023 kart category, the transition to F4 requires deeper knowledge of aerodynamic grip and braking with a heavier, faster car. Engineer Benjamin walks him through graphs that highlight lateral acceleration in high-speed corners, encouraging him to trust the downforce more. Meanwhile, Mathilda consults with Engineer Matteo, looking to refine her race starts and corner approach. Her background in German junior motorsport taught her discipline, but the complexity of single-seater racing always provides new learning curves. Sebastian, the Danish F4 rookie champion in 2024, meets with Ruggiero to revisit his timing in mid-corner transitions—he wants to carry more speed without unsettling the car in tricky sections.

By around 8:30 or 9:00 a.m., after these detailed engineering discussions, mechanics such as Lorenzo and Sale (both Mechanic 61), Roc and Marco (Mechanic 62), and Roberto or Luca (Mechanic 18) gather with the drivers for a final check of seat positioning, mirrors, and radio communication. Each detail is carefully tuned, ensuring the car feels like an extension of the driver. From there, it’s time for the first track session. Engines fire up, the garage door lifts, and each driver carefully navigates the pit lane to blend onto the circuit for some valuable seat time.

<h2>Afternoon at the limit</h2>

Once the morning sessions conclude, the drivers return to the garage for debriefs. The midday period is a whirlwind of activity. Race engineers retrieve the telemetry logs while drivers rehydrate and prepare mentally for the next round on track. In these moments, the synergy between driver and team is paramount. The data can show that, for instance, Andrea gained two tenths of a second in the first sector but lost three tenths in the final corner. Or that Mathilda’s braking pressure improved from run to run, but her corner exit speed in Sector 2 remains inconsistent. Once the group identifies key targets for improvement, they set off on a short lunch break—though few drivers can truly relax, because their minds remain on the next laps.

After lunch, the real fine-tuning begins. If a driver is struggling with corner entry stability, mechanics might adjust the front wing angle or slightly alter the suspension setup. If the track is particularly hot (for instance, in the heart of a Spanish summer during the Formula Winter Series), they may switch to brand-new Pirelli tires to see if they can extract a better reference lap time. Sometimes they rely on older, used tires to simulate race conditions—or to ensure the driver isn’t gaining speed simply from fresh rubber. The entire afternoon revolves around incremental improvements, culminating in that sweet moment when driver and machine feel perfectly meshed.

<h3>Learning from data: telemetry sessions</h3>

In the engineering office, a driver’s performance on track becomes lines on a graph and numbers on a screen. Telemetry provides an unfiltered look into the car’s behavior—from engine RPM to throttle pressure, from brake bias usage to suspension travel. Graph overlays compare driver performance with an ideal reference lap or even with older runs. The aim is always the same: identify patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.

One of the key elements of an F4 driver’s progression is consistency. Sebastian, for instance, might produce a stunning lap time early in the session, but if he can’t replicate it consistently due to missed braking points or tire fade, that is critical information. Usually, Ruggiero, Lorenzo, and the rest of the crew will deduce where the discrepancy lies and figure out how to address it. It might be as simple as altering the brake bias fractionally or coaching Sebastian to approach a corner with a different line to preserve tire life.

For AS Motorsport, viewing data also helps shape long-term development strategies. By identifying a driver’s technical or mental stumbling blocks, the team can implement specialized exercises both on and off the track. Sometimes, that means focusing on reaction times in the simulator or performing additional physical training tailored to controlling understeer with a heavier fuel load. In other cases, it might involve practicing high-speed corner entries to boost confidence. Every data point serves a larger mission: forging well-rounded, highly competitive drivers who can excel in the FWS, the Euro 4 Championship, the F4 Italian Championship, or the F4 CEZ Championship.

<h2>Life beyond the cockpit</h2>

Though the majority of an AS Motorsport driver’s day is dedicated to on-track performance and engineering analysis, life off the track is equally vital to long-term success. Around mid- to late-afternoon—once the main track sessions conclude—other responsibilities come to the fore. One of the biggest aspects is media and sponsor commitments. In a modern motorsport landscape, drivers must be ambassadors for the sport, engaging with fans, sponsors, and media outlets.

While the mechanics pack up equipment or debrief with the engineers, Andrea might head to a sponsored photoshoot for an upcoming press release. Mathilda could record a brief interview segment in the paddock, where she discusses her ambitions in the F4 Italian Championship. Sebastian may check in with local media from his hometown in Denmark, answering questions about progress made during test sessions. Meanwhile, content for social media keeps flowing, whether in the form of short videos from the pit lane or behind-the-scenes photos with engineers. Team Booster Julien often coordinates these diaries, ensuring that fans can see the authenticity and dedication behind AS Motorsport’s daily grind.

<h3>The role of mental resilience</h3>

Long days at the track can be mentally draining. The intense focus required to heel-and-toe on entry, manage brake pressures, and avoid lockups while chasing every hundredth of a second is immense. Add on top of that the desire to meet sponsor obligations, optimize diet and hydration, and remain engaged in engineering discussions—it becomes a tightrope act. That’s why mental conditioning is a core part of off-track life.

For rookie drivers, stepping into the spotlight of the F4 scene can be especially daunting. Even the simplest mistakes can feel magnified when fans and media are watching, and personal expectations run high. AS Motorsport counters this with an environment focused on growth. Mistakes or slower lap times are dissected methodically, not harshly. Drivers are encouraged to treat every session as a learning opportunity. Team Manager Andrej fosters a culture of mutual respect and trust; aligning with the team’s mantra that improvement is incremental yet constant. When the final race weekend arrives—be it at Mugello, Monza, or the Red Bull Ring—drivers carry not just track knowledge but also the psychological strength to handle the demands of professional racing.

<h2>Evening reflection and recovery</h2>

By the time the final checkered flag of the day drops, fatigue starts creeping in. Drivers carefully guide their cars back into the garage and deliver feedback to the teams: “The rear felt light in the mid-corner,” or “I feel like I could brake harder into Turn 3, but the front tires might lock.” Mechanics such as Joan, Roc, or Marco note every word, scanning the car for any mechanical or aerodynamic anomalies. After a thorough post-session inspection, a final debrief takes place between drivers and engineers.

This concluding meeting around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. is an essential part of the AS Motorsport routine. Drivers swap stories about track conditions, the day’s breakthroughs, and any concerns to address in the next outing. The conversation also extends to upcoming championship rounds. For instance, if Andrea plans to compete at Misano in the F4 Italian Championship on May 4, the team will review relevant data from previous visits to that circuit. If Sebastian is prepping for the F4 CEZ Championship at the Red Bull Ring on April 13, or for the Euro 4 Championship at Le Castellet in July, they might delve into particular corners known for tricky descents or brake-zone illusions. Mathilda, heading toward Vallelunga on May 25, might discuss lines through the track’s slower, more technical corners with Matteo.

Once the technical side is settled, drivers change out of their racing gear. Dinner with the team usually follows on test days, giving everyone a chance to unwind. Beyond fueling up, these sit-downs serve as a valuable team-building exercise. Whether it’s a small restaurant near the circuit or a catered meal in the paddock, the conversation flows from racing strategies to jokes about the day’s events. Some of the best improvements and eureka moments happen during these informal gatherings, where the pressure of the track lifts and honest insights can surface.

<h2>A culture of continuous development</h2>

What truly sets AS Motorsport apart is our unwavering dedication to nurturing the next generation of motorsport talent. Even as the drivers head off to rest in preparation for the next day’s activities—perhaps a second day of testing, or travel to the next race circuit—the team is already planning future sessions, analyzing data from that day’s laps, and scheduling further test opportunities. Our philosophy is simple: the more seat time drivers gain, and the more feedback they receive in a supportive environment, the faster they adapt to the demands of F4 racing.

Test days are a cornerstone of our approach. Away from the hustle of actual race weekends, these sessions give each driver the freedom to experiment and make mistakes safely. On top of that, they allow prospective talents—be it a young driver aged 15 to 17 stepping up from karting, an experienced racer looking to refine technique, or a passionate motorsport enthusiast eager to sample true single-seater performance—to understand the level of commitment required to race in F4. Priced at €6,000 for a full day (with optional add-ons like brand-new Pirelli tires or onboard HD video), AS Motorsport’s test days cover everything from professional coaching to telemetry analysis. The result is a holistic experience where the line between “on-track learning” and “off-track personal growth” blurs into one continuous development curve.

For young drivers, these test days can be career-defining. They gain firsthand experience at circuits like Cremona and Vallelunga. They learn how to analyze data with engineers, how to communicate effectively with mechanics, and how to pace themselves physically and mentally through the day. Many also discover whether they truly have the passion and focus to pursue motorsport at higher levels. For everyone who steps into the seat of our F4 cars, the day is not just a test session but a glimpse at the demands and rewards of professional racing.

<h3>From history to the future</h3>

AS Motorsport’s culture of continuous development didn’t materialize overnight. We’re drawing on years of experience, from our roots in rally—where we once prepared Peugeot 206 S1600 cars and competed in iconic events like rally Saturnus, rally Acropolis, and rally Sanremo—to our transition into Formula cars with a Formula Renault 2.0 Caparo. Since then, we’ve kept building upon that heritage, welcoming talented drivers like Lirim Zendeli, Frederik Vesti, and Gasper Mihevc in their formative years. This history, rich with rally wins and expansions into single-seater categories, laid the foundation for the strong engineering, mechanical, and coaching staff now guiding our F4 drivers.

Each year, our team grows more specialized, adapting cutting-edge technology to remain competitive in championships like F4 Italia, the Euro 4 Championship, and the F4 CEZ Championship. It’s a commitment visible not only in the workshop at Via Romanziol 66 A-3 in Noventa di Piave but also at our headquarters in Koper, Slovenia. Whether you glimpse us trackside or in the paddock, you’ll see a motivated family of professionals who relish the grind of building tomorrow’s champions.

<h3>Balancing ambition with everyday life</h3>

Of course, no driver can perform at a peak level if life off the track is chaotic. That’s why AS Motorsport also encourages each driver to find balance amidst their grueling motorsport schedules. Schoolwork, time with family, personal interests—these are the anchors that keep a young driver grounded. Many come from vibrant backgrounds: Andrea from Milano, Mathilda from Köln, Sebastian from Aalborg. Each has had to adapt to the physical travel demands involved in chasing championships across Europe. A day could start with a warmup in Italy and end with a flight to Spain for a test day, or a trip to Austria for the next CEZ round. Through it all, we encourage them to maintain a sense of normalcy—a reminder that they are teenagers with bright academic and social futures, as well as fierce racing ambitions.

The families of these drivers also play a crucial role. Parents, siblings, and close friends often become an extended wing of the team, providing emotional support, traveling to race weekends, and celebrating the triumphs or consoling the heartbreaks that inevitably arise. In many ways, home life and racing life merge—both revolve around discipline, passion, and the unwavering drive to improve.

<h2>The unstoppable drive for excellence</h2>

As the sky darkens over the circuit and the last of the day’s equipment is loaded into transport trucks, drivers reflect on whether they’ve made tangible progress. It might be three-tenths quicker in the final sector or simply greater confidence in corner entry speed. These incremental improvements, stacked day after day, ultimately create the difference between a solid F4 driver and a standout on the path to Formula 3, Formula 2, or even the pinnacle of Formula 1.

At AS Motorsport, we take pride in fostering an environment where every detail is optimized to help each driver chase their dreams. Whether it’s the methodical approach of our engineers, the expertise of our mechanics, the relentless support of our management, or the camaraderie among drivers, our philosophy revolves around synergy. When the team as a whole operates at maximum efficiency, the driver both thrives on track and grows off it. They learn what it means to carry the weight of a team’s expectations, and they discover the satisfaction of reciprocating that trust with strong performances.

In the end, a day in the life of an AS Motorsport F4 driver is an unbroken sequence of small steps taken with unyielding resolve. Early-morning workouts, detailed data analysis, sponsor responsibilities, media duties, mental conditioning—none of these elements alone can shape a champion, but together they build the foundation that makes extraordinary achievement possible. As the final piece of the puzzle, genuine passion for motorsport drives every member of the team, from the office in Koper, Slovenia, to the workshop in Noventa di Piave, Italy. That passion is what sustains us through the highs and lows of the racing journey.

In many ways, the track is the bright stage on which drivers perform, but the real magic happens in the hours of preparation and reflection. When the green flag waves at the start of a race weekend—be it at Imola, Barcelona, Brno, or anywhere else on the calendar—the months or even years of preparation that went into that moment finally converge into the pure adrenaline rush of professional racing. And at every milestone, from test days to podium ceremonies, AS Motorsport stands united, ready to celebrate each new accomplishment and tackle the next challenge.

Ultimately, these daily experiences—waking up before sunrise, poring over telemetry, interacting with fans, adapting to new circuits—are the building blocks of a racing career. Every driver who walks through our garage doors understands that wearing the AS Motorsport colors signifies more than just competing; it means embracing an entire lifestyle centered on excellence. It’s a privilege that demands discipline, resilience, and passion, but the rewards—a sense of deep fulfillment, growth as both a person and an athlete—are unmatched.
